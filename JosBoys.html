<p class='character'><U+FEFF>Chapter 1. TEN YEARS LATER&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If anyone had told me what wonderful changes were to take place here in&nbsp; ten years, I wouldn<U+2019>t have believed it,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo to Mrs Meg, as they&nbsp; sat on the piazza at Plumfield one summer day, looking about them with&nbsp; faces full of pride and pleasure.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This is the sort of magic that money and kind hearts can work. I am&nbsp; sure Mr Laurence could have no nobler monument than the college he so&nbsp; generously endowed; and a home like this will keep Aunt March<U+2019>s memory&nbsp; green as long as it lasts,<U+2019> answered Mrs Meg, always glad to praise the&nbsp; absent.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We used to believe in fairies, you remember, and plan what we<U+2019>d ask&nbsp; for if we could have three wishes. Doesn<U+2019>t it seem as if mine had been&nbsp; really granted at last? Money, fame, and plenty of the work I love,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Mrs Jo, carelessly rumpling up her hair as she clasped her hands&nbsp; over her head just as she used to do when a girl.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have had mine, and Amy is enjoying hers to her heart<U+2019>s content. If&nbsp; dear Marmee, John, and Beth were here, it would be quite perfect,<U+2019> added&nbsp; Meg, with a tender quiver in her voice; for Marmee<U+2019>s place was empty&nbsp; now.&nbsp; &nbsp; Jo put her hand on her sister<U+2019>s, and both sat silent for a little while,&nbsp; surveying the pleasant scene before them with mingled sad and happy&nbsp; thoughts.&nbsp; &nbsp; It certainly did look as if magic had been at work, for quiet Plumfield&nbsp; was transformed into a busy little world. The house seemed more&nbsp; hospitable than ever, refreshed now with new paint, added wings,&nbsp; well-kept lawn and garden, and a prosperous air it had not worn when&nbsp; riotous boys swarmed everywhere and it was rather difficult for the&nbsp; Bhaers to make both ends meet. On the hill, where kites used to be&nbsp; flown, stood the fine college which Mr Laurence<U+2019>s munificent legacy had&nbsp; built. Busy students were going to and fro along the paths once trodden&nbsp; by childish feet, and many young men and women were enjoying all the&nbsp; advantages that wealth, wisdom, and benevolence could give them.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just inside the gates of Plumfield a pretty brown cottage, very like&nbsp; the Dovecote, nestled among the trees, and on the green slope westward&nbsp; Laurie<U+2019>s white-pillared mansion glittered in the sunshine; for when the&nbsp; rapid growth of the city shut in the old house, spoilt Meg<U+2019>s nest, and&nbsp; dared to put a soap-factory under Mr Laurence<U+2019>s indignant nose, our&nbsp; friends emigrated to Plumfield, and the great changes began.&nbsp; &nbsp; These were the pleasant ones; and the loss of the dear old people was&nbsp; sweetened by the blessings they left behind; so all prospered now in the&nbsp; little community, and Mr Bhaer as president, and Mr March as chaplain&nbsp; of the college, saw their long-cherished dream beautifully realized. The&nbsp; sisters divided the care of the young people among them, each taking&nbsp; the part that suited her best. Meg was the motherly friend of the young&nbsp; women, Jo the confidante and defender of all the youths, and Amy the&nbsp; lady Bountiful who delicately smoothed the way for needy students, and&nbsp; entertained them all so cordially that it was no wonder they named her&nbsp; lovely home Mount Parnassus, so full was it of music, beauty, and the&nbsp; culture hungry young hearts and fancies long for.&nbsp; &nbsp; The original twelve boys had of course scattered far and wide during&nbsp; these years, but all that lived still remembered old Plumfield, and came&nbsp; wandering back from the four quarters of the earth to tell their various&nbsp; experiences, laugh over the pleasures of the past, and face the duties&nbsp; of the present with fresh courage; for such home-comings keep hearts&nbsp; tender and hands helpful with the memories of young and happy days. A&nbsp; few words will tell the history of each, and then we can go on with the&nbsp; new chapter of their lives.&nbsp; &nbsp; Franz was with a merchant kinsman in Hamburg, a man of twenty-six now,&nbsp; and doing well. Emil was the jolliest tar that ever <U+2018>sailed the ocean&nbsp; blue<U+2019>. His uncle sent him on a long voyage to disgust him with this&nbsp; adventurous life; but he came home so delighted with it that it was&nbsp; plain this was his profession, and the German kinsman gave him a good&nbsp; chance in his ships; so the lad was happy. Dan was a wanderer still; for&nbsp; after the geological researches in South America he tried sheep-farming&nbsp; in Australia, and was now in California looking up mines. Nat was busy&nbsp; with music at the Conservatory, preparing for a year or two in Germany&nbsp; to finish him off. Tom was studying medicine and trying to like it.&nbsp; Jack was in business with his father, bent on getting rich. Dolly was in&nbsp; college with Stuffy and Ned reading law. Poor little Dick was dead, so&nbsp; was Billy; and no one could mourn for them, since life would never be&nbsp; happy, afflicted as they were in mind and body.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob and Teddy were called the <U+2018>Lion and the Lamb<U+2019>; for the latter was&nbsp; as rampant as the king of beasts, and the former as gentle as any sheep&nbsp; that ever baaed. Mrs Jo called him <U+2018>my daughter<U+2019>, and found him the&nbsp; most dutiful of children, with plenty of manliness underlying the quiet&nbsp; manners and tender nature. But in Ted she seemed to see all the faults,&nbsp; whims, aspirations, and fun of her own youth in a new shape. With his&nbsp; tawny locks always in wild confusion, his long legs and arms, loud&nbsp; voice, and continual activity, Ted was a prominent figure at Plumfield.&nbsp; He had his moods of gloom, and fell into the Slough of Despond about&nbsp; once a week, to be hoisted out by patient Rob or his mother, who&nbsp; understood when to let him alone and when to shake him up. He was her&nbsp; pride and joy as well as torment, being a very bright lad for his age,&nbsp; and so full of all sorts of budding talent, that her maternal mind was&nbsp; much exercised as to what this remarkable boy would become.&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi had gone through College with honour, and Mrs Meg had set her heart&nbsp; on his being a minister--picturing in her fond fancy the first sermon&nbsp; her dignified young parson would preach, as well as the long, useful,&nbsp; and honoured life he was to lead. But John, as she called him now,&nbsp; firmly declined the divinity school, saying he had had enough of books,&nbsp; and needed to know more of men and the world, and caused the dear woman&nbsp; much disappointment by deciding to try a journalist<U+2019>s career. It was&nbsp; a blow; but she knew that young minds cannot be driven, and that&nbsp; experience is the best teacher; so she let him follow his own&nbsp; inclinations, still hoping to see him in the pulpit. Aunt Jo raged when&nbsp; she found that there was to be a reporter in the family, and called him&nbsp; <U+2018>Jenkins<U+2019> on the spot. She liked his literary tendencies, but had reason&nbsp; to detest official Paul Prys, as we shall see later. Demi knew his own&nbsp; mind, however, and tranquilly carried out his plans, unmoved by the&nbsp; tongues of the anxious mammas or the jokes of his mates. Uncle Teddy&nbsp; encouraged him, and painted a splendid career, mentioning Dickens and&nbsp; other celebrities who began as reporters and ended as famous novelists&nbsp; or newspaper men.&nbsp; &nbsp; The girls were all flourishing. Daisy, as sweet and domestic as ever,&nbsp; was her mother<U+2019>s comfort and companion. Josie at fourteen was a most&nbsp; original young person, full of pranks and peculiarities, the latest of&nbsp; which was a passion for the stage, which caused her quiet mother and&nbsp; sister much anxiety as well as amusement. Bess had grown into a tall,&nbsp; beautiful girl looking several years older than she was, with the same&nbsp; graceful ways and dainty tastes which the little Princess had, and a&nbsp; rich inheritance of both the father<U+2019>s and mother<U+2019>s gifts, fostered by&nbsp; every aid love and money could give. But the pride of the community&nbsp; was naughty Nan; for, like so many restless, wilful children, she&nbsp; was growing into a woman full of the energy and promise that suddenly&nbsp; blossoms when the ambitious seeker finds the work she is fitted to do&nbsp; well. Nan began to study medicine at sixteen, and at twenty was getting&nbsp; on bravely; for now, thanks to other intelligent women, colleges and&nbsp; hospitals were open to her. She had never wavered in her purpose from&nbsp; the childish days when she shocked Daisy in the old willow by saying: <U+2018>I&nbsp; don<U+2019>t want any family to fuss over. I shall have an office, with bottles&nbsp; and pestle things in it, and drive round and cure folks.<U+2019> The future&nbsp; foretold by the little girl the young woman was rapidly bringing to&nbsp; pass, and finding so much happiness in it that nothing could win her&nbsp; from the chosen work. Several worthy young gentlemen had tried to make&nbsp; her change her mind and choose, as Daisy did, <U+2018>a nice little house and&nbsp; family to take care of<U+2019>. But Nan only laughed, and routed the lovers&nbsp; by proposing to look at the tongue which spoke of adoration, or&nbsp; professionally felt the pulse in the manly hand offered for her&nbsp; acceptance. So all departed but one persistent youth, who was such a&nbsp; devoted Traddles it was impossible to quench him.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was Tom, who was as faithful to his child sweetheart as she to&nbsp; her <U+2018>pestle things<U+2019>, and gave a proof of fidelity that touched her very&nbsp; much. He studied medicine for her sake alone, having no taste for it,&nbsp; and a decided fancy for a mercantile life. But Nan was firm, and&nbsp; Tom stoutly kept on, devoutly hoping he might not kill many of his&nbsp; fellow-beings when he came to practise. They were excellent friends,&nbsp; however, and caused much amusement to their comrades, by the&nbsp; vicissitudes of this merry love-chase.&nbsp; &nbsp; Both were approaching Plumfield on the afternoon when Mrs Meg and Mrs&nbsp; Jo were talking on the piazza. Not together; for Nan was walking briskly&nbsp; along the pleasant road alone, thinking over a case that interested her,&nbsp; and Tom was pegging on behind to overtake her, as if by accident, when&nbsp; the suburbs of the city were past--a little way of his, which was part&nbsp; of the joke.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan was a handsome girl, with a fresh colour, clear eye, quick smile,&nbsp; and the self-poised look young women with a purpose always have. She was&nbsp; simply and sensibly dressed, walked easily, and seemed full of vigour,&nbsp; with her broad shoulders well back, arms swinging freely, and the&nbsp; elasticity of youth and health in every motion. The few people she met&nbsp; turned to look at her, as if it was a pleasant sight to see a hearty,&nbsp; happy girl walking countryward that lovely day; and the red-faced young&nbsp; man steaming along behind, hat off and every tight curl wagging with&nbsp; impatience, evidently agreed with them.&nbsp; &nbsp; Presently a mild <U+2018>Hallo!<U+2019> was borne upon the breeze, and pausing, with&nbsp; an effort to look surprised that was an utter failure, Nan said affably:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, is that you, Tom?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Looks like it. Thought you might be walking out today<U+2019>; and Tom<U+2019>s&nbsp; jovial face beamed with pleasure.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You knew it. How is your throat?<U+2019> asked Nan in her professional tone,&nbsp; which was always a quencher to undue raptures.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Throat? Oh, ah! yes, I remember. It is well. The effect of that&nbsp; prescription was wonderful. I<U+2019>ll never call homoeopathy a humbug again.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You were the humbug this time, and so were the unmedicated pellets&nbsp; I gave you. If sugar or milk can cure diphtheria in this remarkable&nbsp; manner, I<U+2019>ll make a note of it. O Tom, Tom, will you never be done&nbsp; playing tricks?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>O Nan, Nan, will you never be done getting the better of me?<U+2019> And the&nbsp; merry pair laughed at one another just as they did in the old times,&nbsp; which always came back freshly when they went to Plumfield.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, I knew I shouldn<U+2019>t see you for a week if I didn<U+2019>t scare up some&nbsp; excuse for a call at the office. You are so desperately busy all the&nbsp; time I never get a word,<U+2019> explained Tom.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You ought to be busy too, and above such nonsense. Really, Tom, if you&nbsp; don<U+2019>t give your mind to your lectures, you<U+2019>ll never get on,<U+2019> said Nan&nbsp; soberly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have quite enough of them as it is,<U+2019> answered Tom with an air of&nbsp; disgust. <U+2018>A fellow must lark a bit after dissecting corpuses all day.&nbsp; I can<U+2019>t stand it long at a time, though some people seem to enjoy it&nbsp; immensely.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Then why not leave it, and do what suits you better? I always thought&nbsp; it a foolish thing, you know,<U+2019> said Nan, with a trace of anxiety in the&nbsp; keen eyes that searched for signs of illness in a face as ruddy as a&nbsp; Baldwin apple.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You know why I chose it, and why I shall stick to it if it kills me.&nbsp; I may not look delicate, but I<U+2019>ve a deep-seated heart complaint, and it&nbsp; will carry me off sooner or later; for only one doctor in the world can&nbsp; cure it, and she won<U+2019>t.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; There was an air of pensive resignation about Tom that was both comic&nbsp; and pathetic; for he was in earnest, and kept on giving hints of this&nbsp; sort, without the least encouragement.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan frowned; but she was used to it, and knew how to treat him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She is curing it in the best and only way; but a more refractory&nbsp; patient never lived. Did you go to that ball, as I directed?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I did.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And devote yourself to pretty Miss West?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Danced with her the whole evening.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No impression made on that susceptible organ of yours?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not the slightest. I gaped in her face once, forgot to feed her, and&nbsp; gave a sigh of relief when I handed her over to her mamma.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Repeat the dose as often as possible, and note the symptoms. I predict&nbsp; that you<U+2019>ll <U+201C>cry for it<U+201D> by and by.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Never! I<U+2019>m sure it doesn<U+2019>t suit my constitution.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We shall see. Obey orders!<U+2019> sternly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, Doctor,<U+2019> meekly.&nbsp; &nbsp; Silence reigned for a moment; then, as if the bone of contention was&nbsp; forgotten in the pleasant recollections called up by familiar objects,&nbsp; Nan said suddenly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What fun we used to have in that wood! Do you remember how you tumbled&nbsp; out of the big nut-tree and nearly broke your collar-bones?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t I! and how you steeped me in wormwood till I was a fine mahogany&nbsp; colour, and Aunt Jo wailed over my spoilt jacket,<U+2019> laughed Tom, a boy&nbsp; again in a minute.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And how you set the house afire?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And you ran off for your band-box?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do you ever say <U+201C>Thunder-turtles<U+201D> now?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do people ever call you <U+201C>Giddy-gaddy<U+201D>?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Daisy does. Dear thing, I haven<U+2019>t seen her for a week.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I saw Demi this morning, and he said she was keeping house for Mother&nbsp; Bhaer.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She always does when Aunt Jo gets into a vortex. Daisy is a model&nbsp; housekeeper; and you couldn<U+2019>t do better than make your bow to her, if&nbsp; you can<U+2019>t go to work and wait till you are grown up before you begin&nbsp; lovering.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Nat would break his fiddle over my head if I suggested such a thing.&nbsp; No, thank you. Another name is engraved upon my heart as indelibly&nbsp; as the blue anchor on my arm. <U+201C>Hope<U+201D> is my motto, and <U+201C>No surrender<U+201D>,&nbsp; yours; see who will hold out longest.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You silly boys think we must pair off as we did when children; but we&nbsp; shall do nothing of the kind. How well Parnassus looks from here!<U+2019> said&nbsp; Nan, abruptly changing the conversation again.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is a fine house; but I love old Plum best. Wouldn<U+2019>t Aunt March stare&nbsp; if she could see the changes here?<U+2019> answered Tom, as they both paused at&nbsp; the great gate to look at the pleasant landscape before them.&nbsp; &nbsp; A sudden whoop startled them, as a long boy with a wild yellow head came&nbsp; leaping over a hedge like a kangaroo, followed by a slender girl, who&nbsp; stuck in the hawthorn, and sat there laughing like a witch. A pretty&nbsp; little lass she was, with curly dark hair, bright eyes, and a very&nbsp; expressive face. Her hat was at her back, and her skirts a good deal the&nbsp; worse for the brooks she had crossed, the trees she had climbed, and the&nbsp; last leap, which added several fine rents.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Take me down, Nan, please. Tom, hold Ted; he<U+2019>s got my book, and I&nbsp; will have it,<U+2019> called Josie from her perch, not at all daunted by the&nbsp; appearance of her friends.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom promptly collared the thief, while Nan picked Josie from among the&nbsp; thorns and set her on her feet without a word of reproof; for having&nbsp; been a romp in her own girlhood, she was very indulgent to like tastes&nbsp; in others. <U+2018>What<U+2019>s the matter, dear?<U+2019> she asked, pinning up the longest&nbsp; rip, while Josie examined the scratches on her hands. <U+2018>I was studying my&nbsp; part in the willow, and Ted came slyly up and poked the book out of my&nbsp; hands with his rod. It fell in the brook, and before I could scrabble&nbsp; down he was off. You wretch, give it back this moment or I<U+2019>ll box your&nbsp; ears,<U+2019> cried Josie, laughing and scolding in the same breath.&nbsp; &nbsp; Escaping from Tom, Ted struck a sentimental attitude, and with tender&nbsp; glances at the wet, torn young person before him, delivered Claude&nbsp; Melnotte<U+2019>s famous speech in a lackadaisical way that was irresistibly&nbsp; funny, ending with <U+2018>Dost like the picture, love?<U+2019> as he made an object&nbsp; of himself by tying his long legs in a knot and distorting his face&nbsp; horribly.&nbsp; &nbsp; The sound of applause from the piazza put a stop to these antics, and&nbsp; the young folks went up the avenue together very much in the old style&nbsp; when Tom drove four in hand and Nan was the best horse in the team.&nbsp; Rosy, breathless, and merry, they greeted the ladies and sat down on&nbsp; the steps to rest, Aunt Meg sewing up her daughter<U+2019>s rags while Mrs&nbsp; Jo smoothed the Lion<U+2019>s mane, and rescued the book. Daisy appeared in a&nbsp; moment to greet her friend, and all began to talk.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Muffins for tea; better stay and eat <U+2018>em; Daisy<U+2019>s never fail,<U+2019> said Ted&nbsp; hospitably.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He<U+2019>s a judge; he ate nine last time. That<U+2019>s why he<U+2019>s so fat,<U+2019> added&nbsp; Josie, with a withering glance at her cousin, who was as thin as a lath.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I must go and see Lucy Dove. She has a whitlow, and it<U+2019>s time to lance&nbsp; it. I<U+2019>ll tea at college,<U+2019> answered Nan, feeling in her pocket to be sure&nbsp; she had not forgotten her case of instruments.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thanks, I<U+2019>m going there also. Tom Merryweather has granulated lids,&nbsp; and I promised to touch them up for him. Save a doctor<U+2019>s fee and be good&nbsp; practice for me. I<U+2019>m clumsy with my thumbs,<U+2019> said Tom, bound to be near&nbsp; his idol while he could.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hush! Daisy doesn<U+2019>t like to hear you saw-bones talk of your work.&nbsp; Muffins suit us better<U+2019>; and Ted grinned sweetly, with a view to future&nbsp; favours in the eating line.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Any news of the Commodore?<U+2019> asked Tom.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He is on his way home, and Dan hopes to come soon. I long to see my&nbsp; boys together, and have begged the wanderers to come to Thanksgiving, if&nbsp; not before,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, beaming at the thought.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They<U+2019>ll come, every man of them, if they can. Even Jack will risk&nbsp; losing a dollar for the sake of one of our jolly old dinners,<U+2019> laughed&nbsp; Tom.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>There<U+2019>s the turkey fattening for the feast. I never chase him now, but&nbsp; feed him well; and he<U+2019>s <U+201C>swellin<U+2019> wisibly<U+201D>, bless his drumsticks!<U+2019> said&nbsp; Ted, pointing out the doomed fowl proudly parading in a neighbouring&nbsp; field.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If Nat goes the last of the month we shall want a farewell frolic for&nbsp; him. I suppose the dear old Chirper will come home a second Ole Bull,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Nan to her friend.&nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty colour came into Daisy<U+2019>s cheek, and the folds of muslin on her&nbsp; breast rose and fell with a quick breath; but she answered placidly:&nbsp; <U+2018>Uncle Laurie says he has real talent, and after the training he will&nbsp; get abroad he can command a good living here, though he may never be&nbsp; famous.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Young people seldom turn out as one predicts, so it is of little use&nbsp; to expect anything,<U+2019> said Mrs Meg with a sigh. <U+2018>If our children are good&nbsp; and useful men and women, we should be satisfied; yet it<U+2019>s very natural&nbsp; to wish them to be brilliant and successful.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They are like my chickens, mighty uncertain. Now, that fine-looking&nbsp; cockerel of mine is the stupidest one of the lot, and the ugly,&nbsp; long-legged chap is the king of the yard, he<U+2019>s so smart; crows loud&nbsp; enough to wake the Seven Sleepers; but the handsome one croaks, and is&nbsp; no end of a coward. I get snubbed; but you wait till I grow up, and&nbsp; then see<U+2019>; and Ted looked so like his own long-legged pet that everyone&nbsp; laughed at his modest prediction.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I want to see Dan settled somewhere. <U+201C>A rolling stone gathers no moss<U+201D>,&nbsp; and at twenty-five he is still roaming about the world without a tie to&nbsp; hold him, except this<U+2019>; and Mrs Meg nodded towards her sister.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dan will find his place at last, and experience is his best teacher.&nbsp; He is rough still, but each time he comes home I see a change for the&nbsp; better, and never lose my faith in him. He may never do anything great,&nbsp; or get rich; but if the wild boy makes an honest man, I<U+2019>m satisfied,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Mrs Jo, who always defended the black sheep of her flock.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s right, mother, stand by Dan! He<U+2019>s worth a dozen Jacks and Neds&nbsp; bragging about money and trying to be swells. You see if he doesn<U+2019>t do&nbsp; something to be proud of and take the wind out of their sails,<U+2019>&nbsp; added Ted, whose love for his <U+2018>Danny<U+2019> was now strengthened by a boy<U+2019>s&nbsp; admiration for the bold, adventurous man.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hope so, I<U+2019>m sure. He<U+2019>s just the fellow to do rash things and come&nbsp; to glory--climbing the Matterhorn, taking a <U+201C>header<U+201D> into Niagara, or&nbsp; finding a big nugget. That<U+2019>s his way of sowing wild oats, and perhaps&nbsp; it<U+2019>s better than ours,<U+2019> said Tom thoughtfully; for he had gained a good&nbsp; deal of experience in that sort of agriculture since he became a medical&nbsp; student.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Much better!<U+2019> said Mrs Jo emphatically. <U+2018>I<U+2019>d rather send my boys off&nbsp; to see the world in that way than leave them alone in a city full of&nbsp; temptations, with nothing to do but waste time, money, and health, as&nbsp; so many are left. Dan has to work his way, and that teaches him courage,&nbsp; patience, and self-reliance. I don<U+2019>t worry about him as much as I do&nbsp; about George and Dolly at college, no more fit than two babies to take&nbsp; care of themselves.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How about John? He<U+2019>s knocking round town as a newspaper man, reporting&nbsp; all sorts of things, from sermons to prize-fights,<U+2019> asked Tom, who&nbsp; thought that sort of life would be much more to his own taste than&nbsp; medical lectures and hospital wards.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Demi has three safeguards--good principles, refined tastes, and a wise&nbsp; mother. He won<U+2019>t come to harm, and these experiences will be useful to&nbsp; him when he begins to write, as I<U+2019>m sure he will in time,<U+2019> began Mrs&nbsp; Jo in her prophetic tone; for she was anxious to have some of her geese&nbsp; turn out swans.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Speak of Jenkins, and you<U+2019>ll hear the rustling of his paper,<U+2019> cried&nbsp; Tom, as a fresh-faced, brown-eyed young man came up the avenue, waving a&nbsp; newspaper over his head.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s your Evening Tattler! Latest Edition! Awful murder! Bank clerk&nbsp; absconded! Powder-mill explosion, and great strike of the Latin School&nbsp; boys!<U+2019> roared Ted, going to meet his cousin with the graceful gait of a&nbsp; young giraffe.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The Commodore is in, and will cut his cable and run before the wind&nbsp; as soon as he can get off,<U+2019> called Demi, with <U+2018>a nice derangement of&nbsp; nautical epitaphs<U+2019>, as he came up smiling over his good news.&nbsp; &nbsp; Everyone talked together for a moment, and the paper passed from hand to&nbsp; hand that each eye might rest on the pleasant fact that the Brenda, from&nbsp; Hamburg, was safe in port.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He<U+2019>ll come lurching out by tomorrow with his usual collection of marine&nbsp; monsters and lively yarns. I saw him, jolly and tarry and brown as a&nbsp; coffee-berry. Had a good run, and hopes to be second mate, as the other&nbsp; chap is laid up with a broken leg,<U+2019> added Demi.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Wish I had the setting of it,<U+2019> said Nan to herself, with a professional&nbsp; twist of her hand.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How<U+2019>s Franz?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He<U+2019>s going to be married! There<U+2019>s news for you. The first of the&nbsp; flock, Aunty, so say good-bye to him. Her name is Ludmilla Heldegard&nbsp; Blumenthal; good family, well-off, pretty, and of course an angel. The&nbsp; dear old boy wants Uncle<U+2019>s consent, and then he will settle down to be a&nbsp; happy and an honest burgher. Long life to him!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad to hear it. I do so like to settle my boys with a good wife&nbsp; and a nice little home. Now, if all is right, I shall feel as if Franz&nbsp; was off my mind,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, folding her hands contentedly; for she&nbsp; often felt like a distracted hen with a large brood of mixed chickens&nbsp; and ducks upon her hands.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So do I,<U+2019> sighed Tom, with a sly glance at Nan. <U+2018>That<U+2019>s what a fellow&nbsp; needs to keep him steady; and it<U+2019>s the duty of nice girls to marry as&nbsp; soon as possible, isn<U+2019>t it, Demi?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If there are enough nice fellows to go round. The female population&nbsp; exceeds the male, you know, especially in New England; which accounts&nbsp; for the high state of culture we are in, perhaps,<U+2019> answered John, who&nbsp; was leaning over his mother<U+2019>s chair, telling his day<U+2019>s experiences in a&nbsp; whisper.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is a merciful provision, my dears; for it takes three or four women&nbsp; to get each man into, through, and out of the world. You are costly&nbsp; creatures, boys; and it is well that mothers, sisters, wives, and&nbsp; daughters love their duty and do it so well, or you would perish off the&nbsp; face of the earth,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo solemnly, as she took up a basket filled&nbsp; with dilapidated hose; for the good Professor was still hard on his&nbsp; socks, and his sons resembled him in that respect.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Such being the case, there is plenty for the <U+201C>superfluous women<U+201D> to do,&nbsp; in taking care of these helpless men and their families. I see that more&nbsp; clearly every day, and am very glad and grateful that my profession will&nbsp; make me a useful, happy, and independent spinster.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan<U+2019>s emphasis on the last word caused Tom to groan, and the rest to&nbsp; laugh.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I take great pride and solid satisfaction in you, Nan, and hope to&nbsp; see you very successful; for we do need just such helpful women in the&nbsp; world. I sometimes feel as if I<U+2019>ve missed my vocation and ought to&nbsp; have remained single; but my duty seemed to point this way, and I don<U+2019>t&nbsp; regret it,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, folding a large and very ragged blue sock to&nbsp; her bosom.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Neither do I. What should I ever have done without my dearest Mum?<U+2019>&nbsp; added Ted, with a filial hug which caused both to disappear behind the&nbsp; newspaper in which he had been mercifully absorbed for a few minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My darling boy, if you would wash your hands semi-occasionally, fond&nbsp; caresses would be less disastrous to my collar. Never mind, my precious&nbsp; touslehead, better grass stains and dirt than no cuddlings at all<U+2019>; and&nbsp; Mrs Jo emerged from that brief eclipse looking much refreshed, though&nbsp; her back hair was caught in Ted<U+2019>s buttons and her collar under one ear.&nbsp; &nbsp; Here Josie, who had been studying her part at the other end of the&nbsp; piazza, suddenly burst forth with a smothered shriek, and gave Juliet<U+2019>s&nbsp; speech in the tomb so effectively that the boys applauded, Daisy&nbsp; shivered, and Nan murmured: <U+2018>Too much cerebral excitement for one of her&nbsp; age.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m afraid you<U+2019>ll have to make up your mind to it, Meg. That child is&nbsp; a born actress. We never did anything so well, not even the Witch<U+2019>s&nbsp; Curse,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, casting a bouquet of many-coloured socks at the&nbsp; feet of her flushed and panting niece, when she fell gracefully upon the&nbsp; door-mat.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is a sort of judgement upon me for my passion for the stage when a&nbsp; girl. Now I know how dear Marmee felt when I begged to be an actress. I&nbsp; never can consent, and yet I may be obliged to give up my wishes, hopes,&nbsp; and plans again.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; There was an accent of reproach in his mother<U+2019>s voice, which made Demi&nbsp; pick up his sister with a gentle shake, and the stern command to <U+2018>drop&nbsp; that nonsense in public<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Drop me, Minion, or I<U+2019>ll give you the Maniac Bride, with my best&nbsp; Ha-ha!<U+2019> cried Josie, glaring at him like an offended kitten. Being set&nbsp; on her feet, she made a splendid courtesy, and dramatically proclaiming,&nbsp; <U+2018>Mrs Woffington<U+2019>s carriage waits,<U+2019> swept down the steps and round the&nbsp; corner, trailing Daisy<U+2019>s scarlet shawl majestically behind her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Isn<U+2019>t she great fun? I couldn<U+2019>t stop in this dull place if I hadn<U+2019>t&nbsp; that child to make it lively for me. If ever she turns prim, I<U+2019>m off; so&nbsp; mind how you nip her in the bud,<U+2019> said Teddy, frowning at Demi, who was&nbsp; now writing out shorthand notes on the steps.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You two are a team, and it takes a strong hand to drive you, but I&nbsp; rather like it. Josie ought to have been my child, and Rob yours, Meg.&nbsp; Then your house would have been all peace and mine all Bedlam. Now I&nbsp; must go and tell Laurie the news. Come with me, Meg, a little stroll&nbsp; will do us good<U+2019>; and sticking Ted<U+2019>s straw hat on her head, Mrs Jo&nbsp; walked off with her sister, leaving Daisy to attend to the muffins, Ted&nbsp; to appease Josie, and Tom and Nan to give their respective patients a&nbsp; very bad quarter of an hour.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 2. PARNASSUS&nbsp; &nbsp; It was well named; and the Muses seemed to be at home that day, for as&nbsp; the newcomers went up the slope appropriate sights and sounds greeted&nbsp; them. Passing an open window, they looked in upon a library presided&nbsp; over by Clio, Calliope, and Urania; Melpomene and Thalia were disporting&nbsp; themselves in the hall, where some young people were dancing and&nbsp; rehearsing a play; Erato was walking in the garden with her lover, and&nbsp; in the music-room Phoebus himself was drilling a tuneful choir.&nbsp; &nbsp; A mature Apollo was our old friend Laurie, but comely and genial as&nbsp; ever; for time had ripened the freakish boy into a noble man. Care and&nbsp; sorrow, as well as ease and happiness, had done much for him; and the&nbsp; responsibility of carrying out his grandfather<U+2019>s wishes had been a&nbsp; duty most faithfully performed. Prosperity suits some people, and they&nbsp; blossom best in a glow of sunshine; others need the shade, and are the&nbsp; sweeter for a touch of frost. Laurie was one of the former sort, and&nbsp; Amy was another; so life had been a kind of poem to them since they&nbsp; married--not only harmonious and happy, but earnest, useful, and rich in&nbsp; the beautiful benevolence which can do so much when wealth and wisdom go&nbsp; hand in hand with charity. Their house was full of unostentatious beauty&nbsp; and comfort, and here the art-loving host and hostess attracted and&nbsp; entertained artists of all kinds. Laurie had music enough now, and was a&nbsp; generous patron to the class he most liked to help. Amy had her proteges&nbsp; among ambitious young painters and sculptors, and found her own art&nbsp; double dear as her daughter grew old enough to share its labours and&nbsp; delights with her; for she was one of those who prove that women can be&nbsp; faithful wives and mothers without sacrificing the special gift bestowed&nbsp; upon them for their own development and the good of others.&nbsp; &nbsp; Her sisters knew where to find her, and Jo went at once to the studio,&nbsp; where mother and daughter worked together. Bess was busy with the bust&nbsp; of a little child, while her mother added the last touches to a fine&nbsp; head of her husband. Time seemed to have stood still with Amy, for&nbsp; happiness had kept her young and prosperity given her the culture she&nbsp; needed. A stately, graceful woman, who showed how elegant simplicity&nbsp; could be made by the taste with which she chose her dress and the grace&nbsp; with which she wore it. As someone said: <U+2018>I never know what Mrs Laurence&nbsp; has on, but I always receive the impression that she is the best-dressed&nbsp; lady in the room.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was evident that she adored her daughter, and well she might; for&nbsp; the beauty she had longed for seemed, to her fond eyes at least, to&nbsp; be impersonated in this younger self. Bess inherited her mother<U+2019>s&nbsp; Diana-like figure, blue eyes, fair skin, and golden hair, tied up in&nbsp; the same classic knot of curls. Also--ah! never-ending source of joy to&nbsp; Amy--she had her father<U+2019>s handsome nose and mouth, cast in a feminine&nbsp; mould. The severe simplicity of a long linen pinafore suited her;&nbsp; and she worked away with the entire absorption of the true artist,&nbsp; unconscious of the loving eyes upon her, till Aunt Jo came in exclaiming&nbsp; eagerly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My dear girls, stop your mud-pies and hear the news!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Both artists dropped their tools and greeted the irrepressible woman&nbsp; cordially, though genius had been burning splendidly and her coming&nbsp; spoilt a precious hour. They were in the full tide of gossip when&nbsp; Laurie, who had been summoned by Meg, arrived, and sitting down between&nbsp; the sisters, with no barricade anywhere, listened with interest to the&nbsp; news of Franz and Emil.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The epidemic has broke out, and now it will rage and ravage your flock.&nbsp; Be prepared for every sort of romance and rashness for the next ten&nbsp; years, Jo. Your boys are growing up and will plunge headlong into a sea&nbsp; of worse scrapes than any you have had yet,<U+2019> said Laurie, enjoying her&nbsp; look of mingled delight and despair.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know it, and I hope I shall be able to pull them through and land&nbsp; them safely; but it<U+2019>s an awful responsibility, for they will come to me&nbsp; and insist that I can make their poor little loves run smoothly. I&nbsp; like it, though, and Meg is such a mush of sentiment she revels in the&nbsp; prospect,<U+2019> answered Jo, feeling pretty easy about her own boys, whose&nbsp; youth made them safe for the present.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m afraid she won<U+2019>t revel when our Nat begins to buzz too near her&nbsp; Daisy. Of course you see what all that means? As musical director I am&nbsp; also his confidante, and would like to know what advice to give,<U+2019> said&nbsp; Laurie soberly. <U+2018>Hush! you forget that child,<U+2019> began Jo, nodding towards&nbsp; Bess, who was at work again.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless you! she<U+2019>s in Athens, and doesn<U+2019>t hear a word. She ought to leave&nbsp; off, though, and go out. My darling, put the baby to sleep, and go for&nbsp; a run. Aunt Meg is in the parlour; go and show her the new pictures till&nbsp; we come,<U+2019> added Laurie, looking at his tall girl as Pygmalion might have&nbsp; looked at Galatea; for he considered her the finest statue in the house.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, papa; but please tell me if it is good<U+2019>; and Bess obediently put&nbsp; down her tools, with a lingering glance at the bust.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My cherished daughter, truth compels me to confess that one cheek is&nbsp; plumper than the other; and the curls upon its infant brow are rather&nbsp; too much like horns for perfect grace; otherwise it rivals Raphael<U+2019>s&nbsp; Chanting Cherubs, and I<U+2019>m proud of it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Laurie was laughing as he spoke; for these first attempts were so like&nbsp; Amy<U+2019>s early ones, it was impossible to regard them as soberly as the&nbsp; enthusiastic mamma did.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You can<U+2019>t see beauty in anything but music,<U+2019> answered Bess, shaking the&nbsp; golden head that made the one bright spot in the cool north lights of&nbsp; the great studio.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, I see beauty in you, dear. And if you are not art, what is? I&nbsp; wish to put a little more nature into you, and get you away from this&nbsp; cold clay and marble into the sunshine, to dance and laugh as the&nbsp; others do. I want a flesh-and-blood girl, not a sweet statue in a grey&nbsp; pinafore, who forgets everything but her work.<U+2019> As he spoke, two dusty&nbsp; hands came round his neck, and Bess said earnestly, punctuating her&nbsp; words with soft touches of her lips:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I never forget you, papa; but I do want to do something beautiful that&nbsp; you may be proud of me by and by. Mamma often tells me to stop; but when&nbsp; we get in here we forget there is any world outside, we are so busy and&nbsp; so happy. Now I<U+2019>ll go and run and sing, and be a girl to please you.<U+2019>&nbsp; And throwing away the apron, Bess vanished from the room, seeming to&nbsp; take all the light with her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad you said that. The dear child is too much absorbed in her&nbsp; artistic dreams for one so young. It is my fault; but I sympathize so&nbsp; deeply in it all, I forget to be wise,<U+2019> sighed Amy, carefully covering&nbsp; the baby with a wet towel.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I think this power of living in our children is one of the sweetest&nbsp; things in the world; but I try to remember what Marmee once said to&nbsp; Meg--that fathers should have their share in the education of both girls&nbsp; and boys; so I leave Ted to his father all I can, and Fritz lends me&nbsp; Rob, whose quiet ways are as restful and good for me as Ted<U+2019>s tempests&nbsp; are for his father. Now I advise you, Amy, to let Bess drop the mud-pies&nbsp; for a time, and take up music with Laurie; then she won<U+2019>t be one-sided,&nbsp; and he won<U+2019>t be jealous.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hear, hear! A Daniel--a very Daniel!<U+2019> cried Laurie, well pleased. <U+2018>I&nbsp; thought you<U+2019>d lend a hand, Jo, and say a word for me. I am a little&nbsp; jealous of Amy, and want more of a share in my girl. Come, my lady, let&nbsp; me have her this summer, and next year, when we go to Rome, I<U+2019>ll give&nbsp; her up to you and high art. Isn<U+2019>t that a fair bargain?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I agree; but in trying your hobby, nature, with music thrown in, don<U+2019>t&nbsp; forget that, though only fifteen, our Bess is older than most girls of&nbsp; that age, and cannot be treated like a child. She is so very precious&nbsp; to me, I feel as if I wanted to keep her always as pure and beautiful as&nbsp; the marble she loves so well.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Amy spoke regretfully as she looked about the lovely room where she had&nbsp; spent so many happy hours with this dear child of hers.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018><U+201C>Turn and turn about is fair play<U+201D>, as we used to say when we all&nbsp; wanted to ride on Ellen Tree or wear the russet boots,<U+2019> said Jo briskly;&nbsp; <U+2018>so you must share your girl between you, and see who will do the most&nbsp; for her.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We will,<U+2019> answered the fond parents, laughing at the recollections Jo<U+2019>s&nbsp; proverb brought up to them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How I did use to enjoy bouncing on the limbs of that old apple-tree!&nbsp; No real horse ever gave me half the pleasure or the exercise,<U+2019> said Amy,&nbsp; looking out of the high window as if she saw the dear old orchard again&nbsp; and the little girls at play there.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And what fun I had with those blessed boots!<U+2019> laughed Jo. <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve got the&nbsp; relics now. The boys reduced them to rags; but I love them still, and&nbsp; would enjoy a good theatrical stalk in them if it were possible.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My fondest memories twine about the warming-pan and the sausage. What&nbsp; larks we had! And how long ago it seems!<U+2019> said Laurie, staring at the&nbsp; two women before him as if he found it hard to realize that they ever&nbsp; had been little Amy and riotous Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t suggest that we are growing old, my Lord. We have only bloomed;&nbsp; and a very nice bouquet we make with our buds about us,<U+2019> answered Mrs&nbsp; Amy, shaking out the folds of her rosy muslin with much the air of&nbsp; dainty satisfaction the girl used to show in a new dress.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not to mention our thorns and dead leaves,<U+2019> added Jo, with a sigh; for&nbsp; life had never been very easy to her, and even now she had her troubles&nbsp; both within and without.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come and have a dish of tea, old dear, and see what the young folks are&nbsp; about. You are tired, and want to be <U+201C>stayed with flagons and comforted&nbsp; with apples<U+201D>,<U+2019> said Laurie, offering an arm to each sister, and leading&nbsp; them away to afternoon tea, which flowed as freely on Parnassus as the&nbsp; nectar of old.&nbsp; &nbsp; They found Meg in the summer-parlour, an airy and delightful room, full&nbsp; now of afternoon sunshine and the rustle of trees; for the three long&nbsp; windows opened on the garden. The great music-room was at one end,&nbsp; and at the other, in a deep alcove hung with purple curtains, a little&nbsp; household shrine had been made. Three portraits hung there, two marble&nbsp; busts stood in the corners, and a couch, an oval table, with its urn&nbsp; of flowers, were the only articles of furniture the nook contained. The&nbsp; busts were John Brooke and Beth--Amy<U+2019>s work--both excellent likenesses,&nbsp; and both full of the placid beauty which always recalls the saying,&nbsp; that <U+2018>Clay represents life; plaster, death; marble, immortality<U+2019>. On&nbsp; the right, as became the founder of the house, hung the portrait of Mr&nbsp; Laurence, with its expression of mingled pride and benevolence, as fresh&nbsp; and attractive as when he caught the girl Jo admiring it. Opposite was&nbsp; Aunt March--a legacy to Amy--in an imposing turban, immense sleeves, and&nbsp; long mittens decorously crossed on the front of her plum-coloured satin&nbsp; gown. Time had mellowed the severity of her aspect; and the fixed regard&nbsp; of the handsome old gentleman opposite seemed to account for the amiable&nbsp; simper on lips that had not uttered a sharp word for years.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the place of honour, with the sunshine warm upon it, and a green&nbsp; garland always round it, was Marmee<U+2019>s beloved face, painted with&nbsp; grateful skill by a great artist whom she had befriended when poor and&nbsp; unknown. So beautifully lifelike was it that it seemed to smile down&nbsp; upon her daughters, saying cheerfully:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Be happy; I am with you still.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The three sisters stood a moment looking up at the beloved picture with&nbsp; eyes full of tender reverence and the longing that never left them; for&nbsp; this noble mother had been so much to them that no one could ever fill&nbsp; her place. Only two years since she had gone away to live and love anew,&nbsp; leaving such a sweet memory behind her that it was both an inspiration&nbsp; and a comforter to all the household. They felt this as they drew closer&nbsp; to one another, and Laurie put it into words as he said earnestly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I can ask nothing better for my child than that she may be a woman like&nbsp; our mother. Please God, she shall be, if I can do it; for I owe the best&nbsp; I have to this dear saint.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Just then a fresh voice began to sing <U+2018>Ave Maria<U+2019> in the music-room, and&nbsp; Bess unconsciously echoed her father<U+2019>s prayer for her as she dutifully&nbsp; obeyed his wishes. The soft sound of the air Marmee used to sing led the&nbsp; listeners back into the world again from that momentary reaching after&nbsp; the loved and lost, and they sat down together near the open windows&nbsp; enjoying the music, while Laurie brought them tea, making the little&nbsp; service pleasant by the tender care he gave to it.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nat came in with Demi, soon followed by Ted and Josie, the Professor and&nbsp; his faithful Rob, all anxious to hear more about <U+2018>the boys<U+2019>. The rattle&nbsp; of cups and tongues grew brisk, and the setting sun saw a cheerful&nbsp; company resting in the bright room after the varied labours of the day.&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Bhaer was grey now, but robust and genial as ever; for he had&nbsp; the work he loved, and did it so heartily that the whole college felt&nbsp; his beautiful influence. Rob was as much like him as it was possible for&nbsp; a boy to be, and was already called the <U+2018>young Professor<U+2019>, he so adored&nbsp; study and closely imitated his honoured father in all ways.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, heart<U+2019>s dearest, we go to have our boys again, all two, and&nbsp; may rejoice greatly,<U+2019> said Mr Bhaer, seating himself beside Jo with a&nbsp; beaming face and a handshake of congratulation.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, Fritz, I<U+2019>m so delighted about Emil, and if you approve about Franz&nbsp; also. Did you know Ludmilla? Is it a wise match?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, handing&nbsp; him her cup of tea and drawing closer, as if she welcomed her refuge in&nbsp; joy as well as sorrow.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It all goes well. I saw the Madchen when I went over to place Franz.&nbsp; A child then, but most sweet and charming. Blumenthal is satisfied, I&nbsp; think, and the boy will be happy. He is too German to be content away&nbsp; from Vaterland, so we shall have him as a link between the new and the&nbsp; old, and that pleases me much.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And Emil, he is to be second mate next voyage; isn<U+2019>t that fine? I<U+2019>m so&nbsp; happy that both your boys have done well; you gave up so much for them&nbsp; and their mother. You make light of it, dear, but I never forget it,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Jo, with her hand in his as sentimentally as if she was a girl&nbsp; again and her Fritz had come a-wooing.&nbsp; &nbsp; He laughed his cheery laugh, and whispered behind her fan: <U+2018>If I had not&nbsp; come to America for the poor lads, I never should have found my Jo.&nbsp; The hard times are very sweet now, and I bless Gott for all I seemed to&nbsp; lose, because I gained the blessing of my life.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Spooning! spooning! Here<U+2019>s an awful flirtation on the sly,<U+2019> cried&nbsp; Teddy, peering over the fan just at that interesting moment, much to his&nbsp; mother<U+2019>s confusion and his father<U+2019>s amusement; for the Professor never&nbsp; was ashamed of the fact that he still considered his wife the dearest&nbsp; woman in the world. Rob promptly ejected his brother from one window,&nbsp; to see him skip in at the other, while Mrs Jo shut her fan and held it&nbsp; ready to rap her unruly boy<U+2019>s knuckles if he came near her again.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nat approached in answer to Mr Bhaer<U+2019>s beckoning teaspoon, and stood&nbsp; before them with a face full of the respectful affection he felt for the&nbsp; excellent man who had done so much for him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have the letters ready for thee, my son. They are two old friends of&nbsp; mine in Leipzig, who will befriend thee in that new life. It is well to&nbsp; have them, for thou wilt be heartbroken with Heimweh at the first, Nat,&nbsp; and need comforting,<U+2019> said the Professor, giving him several letters.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thanks, sir. Yes, I expect to be pretty lonely till I get started, then&nbsp; my music and the hope of getting on will cheer me up,<U+2019> answered Nat, who&nbsp; both longed and dreaded to leave all these friends behind him and make&nbsp; new ones.&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a man now; but the blue eyes were as honest as ever, the mouth&nbsp; still a little weak, in spite of the carefully cherished moustache&nbsp; over it, and the broad forehead more plainly than ever betrayed the&nbsp; music-loving nature of the youth. Modest, affectionate, and dutiful, Nat&nbsp; was considered a pleasant though not a brilliant success by Mrs Jo. She&nbsp; loved and trusted him, and was sure he would do his best, but did not&nbsp; expect that he would be great in any way, unless the stimulus of foreign&nbsp; training and self-dependence made him a better artist and a stronger man&nbsp; than now seemed likely.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve marked all your things--or rather, Daisy did--and as soon as your&nbsp; books are collected, we can see about the packing,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, who was&nbsp; so used to fitting boys off for all quarters of the globe that a trip to&nbsp; the North Pole would not have been too much for her.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nat grew red at mention of that name--or was it the last glow of sunset&nbsp; on his rather pale cheek?--and his heart beat happily at the thought of&nbsp; the dear girl working Ns and Bs on his humble socks and handkerchiefs;&nbsp; for Nat adored Daisy, and the cherished dream of his life was to earn&nbsp; a place for himself as a musician and win this angel for his wife. This&nbsp; hope did more for him than the Professor<U+2019>s counsels, Mrs Jo<U+2019>s care, or&nbsp; Mr Laurie<U+2019>s generous help. For her sake he worked, waited, and hoped,&nbsp; finding courage and patience in the dream of that happy future when&nbsp; Daisy should make a little home for him and he fiddle a fortune into her&nbsp; lap. Mrs Jo knew this; and though he was not exactly the man she would&nbsp; have chosen for her niece, she felt that Nat would always need just the&nbsp; wise and loving care Daisy could give him, and that without it there was&nbsp; danger of his being one of the amiable and aimless men who fail for&nbsp; want of the right pilot to steer them safely through the world. Mrs Meg&nbsp; decidedly frowned upon the poor boy<U+2019>s love, and would not hear of giving&nbsp; her dear girl to any but the best man to be found on the face of the&nbsp; earth. She was very kind, but as firm as such gentle souls can be; and&nbsp; Nat fled for comfort to Mrs Jo, who always espoused the interests of&nbsp; her boys heartily. A new set of anxieties was beginning now that the&nbsp; aforesaid boys were growing up, and she foresaw no end of worry as well&nbsp; as amusement in the love-affairs already budding in her flock. Mrs Meg&nbsp; was usually her best ally and adviser, for she loved romances as well&nbsp; now as when a blooming girl herself. But in this case she hardened her&nbsp; heart, and would not hear a word of entreaty. <U+2018>Nat was not man enough,&nbsp; never would be, no one knew his family, a musician<U+2019>s life was a hard&nbsp; one; Daisy was too young, five or six years hence when time had proved&nbsp; both perhaps. Let us see what absence will do for him.<U+2019> And that was the&nbsp; end of it, for when the maternal Pelican was roused she could be very&nbsp; firm, though for her precious children she would have plucked her last&nbsp; feather and given the last drop of her blood.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo was thinking of this as she looked at Nat while he talked&nbsp; with her husband about Leipzig, and she resolved to have a clear&nbsp; understanding with him before he went; for she was used to confidences,&nbsp; and talked freely with her boys about the trials and temptations that&nbsp; beset all lives in the beginning, and so often mar them, for want of the&nbsp; right word at the right moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the first duty of parents, and no false delicacy should&nbsp; keep them from the watchful care, the gentle warning, which makes&nbsp; self-knowledge and self-control the compass and pilot of the young as&nbsp; they leave the safe harbour of home.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Plato and his disciples approach,<U+2019> announced irreverent Teddy, as Mr&nbsp; March came in with several young men and women about him; for the wise&nbsp; old man was universally beloved, and ministered so beautifully to his&nbsp; flock that many of them thanked him all their lives for the help given&nbsp; to both hearts and souls.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bess went to him at once; for since Marmee died, Grandpapa was her&nbsp; special care, and it was sweet to see the golden head bend over the&nbsp; silver one as she rolled out his easy-chair and waited on him with&nbsp; tender alacrity.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Aesthetic tea always on tap here, sir; will you have a flowing bowl&nbsp; or a bit of ambrosia?<U+2019> asked Laurie, who was wandering about with a&nbsp; sugar-basin in one hand and a plate of cake in the other; for sweetening&nbsp; cups and feeding the hungry was work he loved.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Neither, thanks; this child has taken care of me<U+2019>; and Mr March turned&nbsp; to Bess, who sat on one arm of his chair, holding a glass of fresh milk.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Long may she live to do it, sir, and I be here to see this pretty&nbsp; contradiction of the song that <U+201C>youth and age cannot live together<U+201D>!<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Laurie, smiling at the pair. <U+2018><U+201C>Crabbed age<U+201D>, papa; that makes&nbsp; all the difference in the world,<U+2019> said Bess quickly; for she loved&nbsp; poetry, and read the best.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Wouldst thou see fresh roses grow&nbsp;      In a reverend bed of snow?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; quoted Mr March, as Josie came and perched on the other arm, looking&nbsp; like a very thorny little rose; for she had been having a hot discussion&nbsp; with Ted, and had got the worst of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Grandpa, must women always obey men and say they are the wisest, just&nbsp; because they are the strongest?<U+2019> she cried, looking fiercely at her&nbsp; cousin, who came stalking up with a provoking smile on the boyish face&nbsp; that was always very comical atop of that tall figure.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, my dear, that is the old-fashioned belief, and it will take some&nbsp; time to change it. But I think the woman<U+2019>s hour has struck; and it looks&nbsp; to me as if the boys must do their best, for the girls are abreast&nbsp; now, and may reach the goal first,<U+2019> answered Mr March, surveying with&nbsp; paternal satisfaction the bright faces of the young women, who were&nbsp; among the best students in the college.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The poor little Atalantas are sadly distracted and delayed by the&nbsp; obstacles thrown in their way--not golden apples, by any means--but&nbsp; I think they will stand a fair chance when they have learned to run&nbsp; better,<U+2019> laughed Uncle Laurie, stroking Josie<U+2019>s breezy hair, which stood&nbsp; up like the fur of an angry kitten.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Whole barrels of apples won<U+2019>t stop me when I start, and a dozen Teds&nbsp; won<U+2019>t trip me up, though they may try. I<U+2019>ll show him that a woman can&nbsp; act as well, if not better, than a man. It has been done, and will be&nbsp; again; and I<U+2019>ll never own that my brain isn<U+2019>t as good as his, though it&nbsp; may be smaller,<U+2019> cried the excited young person.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If you shake your head in that violent way you<U+2019>ll addle what brains you&nbsp; have got; and I<U+2019>d take care of <U+2018>em, if I were you,<U+2019> began teasing Ted.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What started this civil war?<U+2019> asked Grandpapa, with a gentle emphasis&nbsp; on the adjective, which caused the combatants to calm their ardour a&nbsp; little.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Why, we were pegging away at the Iliad and came to where Zeus tells&nbsp; Juno not to inquire into his plans or he<U+2019>ll whip her, and Jo was&nbsp; disgusted because Juno meekly hushed up. I said it was all right, and&nbsp; agreed with the old fellow that women didn<U+2019>t know much and ought to obey&nbsp; men,<U+2019> explained Ted, to the great amusement of his hearers.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Goddesses may do as they like, but those Greek and Trojan women were&nbsp; poor-spirited things if they minded men who couldn<U+2019>t fight their own&nbsp; battles and had to be hustled off by Pallas, and Venus, and Juno, when&nbsp; they were going to get beaten. The idea of two armies stopping and&nbsp; sitting down while a pair of heroes flung stones at one another! I don<U+2019>t&nbsp; think much of your old Homer. Give me Napoleon or Grant for my hero.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie<U+2019>s scorn was as funny as if a humming-bird scolded at an ostrich,&nbsp; and everyone laughed as she sniffed at the immortal poet and criticized&nbsp; the gods.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Napoleon<U+2019>s Juno had a nice time; didn<U+2019>t she? That<U+2019>s just the way girls&nbsp; argue--first one way and then the other,<U+2019> jeered Ted.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Like Johnson<U+2019>s young lady, who was <U+201C>not categorical, but all&nbsp; wiggle-waggle<U+201D>,<U+2019> added Uncle Laurie, enjoying the battle immensely.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I was only speaking of them as soldiers. But if you come to the woman&nbsp; side of it, wasn<U+2019>t Grant a kind husband and Mrs Grant a happy woman?&nbsp; He didn<U+2019>t threaten to whip her if she asked a natural question; and if&nbsp; Napoleon did do wrong about Josephine, he could fight, and didn<U+2019>t want&nbsp; any Minerva to come fussing over him. They were a stupid set, from&nbsp; dandified Paris to Achilles sulking in his ships, and I won<U+2019>t change my&nbsp; opinion for all the Hectors and Agamemnons in Greece,<U+2019> said Josie, still&nbsp; unconquered.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You can fight like a Trojan, that<U+2019>s evident; and we will be the two&nbsp; obedient armies looking on while you and Ted have it out,<U+2019> began Uncle&nbsp; Laurie, assuming the attitude of a warrior leaning on his spear.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I fear we must give it up, for Pallas is about to descend and carry off&nbsp; our Hector,<U+2019> said Mr March, smiling, as Jo came to remind her son that&nbsp; suppertime was near.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We will fight it out later when there are no goddesses to interfere,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Teddy, as he turned away with unusual alacrity, remembering the&nbsp; treat in store.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Conquered by a muffin, by Jove!<U+2019> called Josie after him, exulting in an&nbsp; opportunity to use the classical exclamation forbidden to her sex.&nbsp; &nbsp; But Ted shot a Parthian arrow as he retired in good order by replying,&nbsp; with a highly virtuous expression:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Obedience is a soldier<U+2019>s first duty.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Bent on her woman<U+2019>s privilege of having the last word, Josie ran after&nbsp; him, but never uttered the scathing speech upon her lips, for a very&nbsp; brown young man in a blue suit came leaping up the steps with a cheery&nbsp; <U+2018>Ahoy! ahoy! where is everybody?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Emil! Emil!<U+2019> cried Josie, and in a moment Ted was upon him, and the&nbsp; late enemies ended their fray in a joyful welcome to the newcomer.&nbsp; &nbsp; Muffins were forgotten, and towing their cousin like two fussy little&nbsp; tugs with a fine merchantman, the children returned to the parlour,&nbsp; where Emil kissed all the women and shook hands with all the men except&nbsp; his uncle; him he embraced in the good old German style, to the great&nbsp; delight of the observers.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Didn<U+2019>t think I could get off today, but found I could, and steered&nbsp; straight for old Plum. Not a soul there, so I luffed and bore away for&nbsp; Parnassus, and here is every man Jack of you. Bless your hearts, how&nbsp; glad I am to see you all!<U+2019> exclaimed the sailor boy, beaming at them, as&nbsp; he stood with his legs apart as if he still felt the rocking deck under&nbsp; his feet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You ought to <U+201C>shiver your timbers<U+201D>, not <U+201C>bless our hearts<U+201D>, Emil; it<U+2019>s&nbsp; not nautical at all. Oh, how nice and shippy and tarry you do smell!<U+2019>&nbsp; said Josie, sniffing at him with great enjoyment of the fresh sea odours&nbsp; he brought with him. This was her favourite cousin, and she was his&nbsp; pet; so she knew that the bulging pockets of the blue jacket contained&nbsp; treasures for her at least.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Avast, my hearty, and let me take soundings before you dive,<U+2019> laughed&nbsp; Emil, understanding her affectionate caresses, and holding her off with&nbsp; one hand while with the other he rummaged out sundry foreign little&nbsp; boxes and parcels marked with different names, and handed them round&nbsp; with appropriate remarks, which caused much laughter; for Emil was a&nbsp; wag.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>There<U+2019>s a hawser that will hold our little cock-boat still about five&nbsp; minutes,<U+2019> he said, throwing a necklace of pretty pink coral over Josie<U+2019>s&nbsp; head; <U+2018>and here<U+2019>s something the mermaids sent to Undine,<U+2019> he added,&nbsp; handing Bess a string of pearly shells on a silver chain.&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought Daisy would like a fiddle, and Nat can find her a beau,<U+2019>&nbsp; continued the sailor, with a laugh, as he undid a dainty filigree brooch&nbsp; in the shape of a violin.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know she will, and I<U+2019>ll take it to her,<U+2019> answered Nat, as he&nbsp; vanished, glad of an errand, and sure that he could find Daisy though&nbsp; Emil had missed her.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil chuckled, and handed out a quaintly carved bear whose head opened,&nbsp; showing a capacious ink-stand. This he presented, with a scrape, to Aunt&nbsp; Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Knowing your fondness for these fine animals, I brought this one to&nbsp; your pen.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very good, Commodore! Try again,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, much pleased with her&nbsp; gift, which caused the Professor to prophesy <U+2018>works of Shakespeare<U+2019> from&nbsp; its depths, so great would be the inspiration of the beloved bruin.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>As Aunt Meg will wear caps, in spite of her youth, I got Ludmilla to&nbsp; get me some bits of lace. Hope you<U+2019>ll like <U+2018>em<U+2019>; and out of a soft paper&nbsp; came some filmy things, one of which soon lay like a net of snowflakes&nbsp; on Mrs Meg<U+2019>s pretty hair.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I couldn<U+2019>t find anything swell enough for Aunt Amy, because she has&nbsp; everything she wants, so I brought a little picture that always makes&nbsp; me think of her when Bess was a baby<U+2019>; and he handed her an oval ivory&nbsp; locket, on which was painted a goldenhaired Madonna, with a rosy child&nbsp; folded in her blue mantle.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How lovely!<U+2019> cried everyone; and Aunt Amy at once hung it about her&nbsp; neck on the blue ribbon from Bess<U+2019>s hair, charmed with her gift; for it&nbsp; recalled the happiest year of her life.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now, I flatter myself I<U+2019>ve got just the thing for Nan, neat but not&nbsp; gaudy, a sort of sign you see, and very appropriate for a doctor,<U+2019> said&nbsp; Emil, proudly displaying a pair of lava earrings shaped like little&nbsp; skulls.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Horrid!<U+2019> And Bess, who hated ugly things, turned her eyes to her own&nbsp; pretty shells.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She won<U+2019>t wear earrings,<U+2019> said Josie.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, she<U+2019>ll enjoy punching your ears then. She<U+2019>s never so happy as&nbsp; when she<U+2019>s overhauling her fellow creatures and going for <U+2018>em with a&nbsp; knife,<U+2019> answered Emil, undisturbed. <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve got a lot of plunder for you&nbsp; fellows in my chest, but I knew I should have no peace till my cargo for&nbsp; the girls was unloaded. Now tell me all the news.<U+2019> And, seated on Amy<U+2019>s&nbsp; best marbletopped table, the sailor swung his legs and talked at the&nbsp; rate of ten knots an hour, till Aunt Jo carried them all off to a grand&nbsp; family tea in honour of the Commodore.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 3. JO<U+2019>S LAST SCRAPE&nbsp; &nbsp; The March family had enjoyed a great many surprises in the course of&nbsp; their varied career, but the greatest of all was when the Ugly Duckling&nbsp; turned out to be, not a swan, but a golden goose, whose literary eggs&nbsp; found such an unexpected market that in ten years Jo<U+2019>s wildest and most&nbsp; cherished dream actually came true. How or why it happened she never&nbsp; clearly understood, but all of a sudden she found herself famous in a&nbsp; small way, and, better still, with a snug little fortune in her pocket&nbsp; to clear away the obstacles of the present and assure the future of her&nbsp; boys.&nbsp; &nbsp; It began during a bad year when everything went wrong at Plumfield;&nbsp; times were hard, the school dwindled, Jo overworked herself and had a&nbsp; long illness; Laurie and Amy were abroad, and the Bhaers too proud to&nbsp; ask help even of those as near and dear as this generous pair. Confined&nbsp; to her room, Jo got desperate over the state of affairs, till she fell&nbsp; back upon the long-disused pen as the only thing she could do to help&nbsp; fill up the gaps in the income. A book for girls being wanted by a&nbsp; certain publisher, she hastily scribbled a little story describing a few&nbsp; scenes and adventures in the lives of herself and sisters, though boys&nbsp; were more in her line, and with very slight hopes of success sent it out&nbsp; to seek its fortune.&nbsp; &nbsp; Things always went by contraries with Jo. Her first book, laboured over&nbsp; for years, and launched full of the high hopes and ambitious dreams of&nbsp; youth, foundered on its voyage, though the wreck continued to float long&nbsp; afterward, to the profit of the publisher at least. The hastily written&nbsp; story, sent away with no thought beyond the few dollars it might bring,&nbsp; sailed with a fair wind and a wise pilot at the helm into public favour,&nbsp; and came home heavily laden with an unexpected cargo of gold and glory.&nbsp; &nbsp; A more astonished woman probably never existed than Josephine Bhaer when&nbsp; her little ship came into port with flags flying, cannon that had been&nbsp; silent before now booming gaily, and, better than all, many kind faces&nbsp; rejoicing with her, many friendly hands grasping hers with cordial&nbsp; congratulations. After that it was plain sailing, and she merely had&nbsp; to load her ships and send them off on prosperous trips, to bring home&nbsp; stores of comfort for all she loved and laboured for.&nbsp; &nbsp; The fame she never did quite accept; for it takes very little fire to&nbsp; make a great deal of smoke nowadays, and notoriety is not real glory.&nbsp; The fortune she could not doubt, and gratefully received; though it was&nbsp; not half so large a one as a generous world reported it to be. The tide&nbsp; having turned continued to rise, and floated the family comfortably into&nbsp; a snug harbour where the older members could rest secure from storms,&nbsp; and whence the younger ones could launch their boats for the voyage of&nbsp; life.&nbsp; &nbsp; All manner of happiness, peace, and plenty came in those years to bless&nbsp; the patient waiters, hopeful workers, and devout believers in the wisdom&nbsp; and justice of Him who sends disappointment, poverty, and sorrow to try&nbsp; the love of human hearts and make success the sweeter when it comes.&nbsp; The world saw the prosperity, and kind souls rejoiced over the improved&nbsp; fortunes of the family; but the success Jo valued most, the happiness&nbsp; that nothing could change or take away, few knew much about.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the power of making her mother<U+2019>s last years happy and serene; to&nbsp; see the burden of care laid down for ever, the weary hands at rest, the&nbsp; dear face untroubled by any anxiety, and the tender heart free to pour&nbsp; itself out in the wise charity which was its delight. As a girl, Jo<U+2019>s&nbsp; favourite plan had been a room where Marmee could sit in peace and enjoy&nbsp; herself after her hard, heroic life. Now the dream had become a happy&nbsp; fact, and Marmee sat in her pleasant chamber with every comfort and&nbsp; luxury about her, loving daughters to wait on her as infirmities&nbsp; increased, a faithful mate to lean upon, and grand-children to brighten&nbsp; the twilight of life with their dutiful affection. A very precious time&nbsp; to all, for she rejoiced as only mothers can in the good fortunes of&nbsp; their children. She had lived to reap the harvest she sowed; had seen&nbsp; prayers answered, hopes blossom, good gifts bear fruit, peace and&nbsp; prosperity bless the home she had made; and then, like some brave,&nbsp; patient angel, whose work was done, turned her face heavenward, glad to&nbsp; rest.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was the sweet and sacred side of the change; but it had its droll&nbsp; and thorny one, as all things have in this curious world of ours. After&nbsp; the first surprise, incredulity, and joy, which came to Jo, with the&nbsp; ingratitude of human nature, she soon tired of renown, and began to&nbsp; resent her loss of liberty. For suddenly the admiring public took&nbsp; possession of her and all her affairs, past, present, and to come.&nbsp; Strangers demanded to look at her, question, advise, warn, congratulate,&nbsp; and drive her out of her wits by well-meant but very wearisome&nbsp; attentions. If she declined to open her heart to them, they reproached&nbsp; her; if she refused to endow her pet charities, relieve private wants,&nbsp; or sympathize with every ill and trial known to humanity, she was called&nbsp; hard-hearted, selfish, and haughty; if she found it impossible to answer&nbsp; the piles of letters sent her, she was neglectful of her duty to&nbsp; the admiring public; and if she preferred the privacy of home to the&nbsp; pedestal upon which she was requested to pose, <U+2018>the airs of literary&nbsp; people<U+2019> were freely criticized.&nbsp; &nbsp; She did her best for the children, they being the public for whom she&nbsp; wrote, and laboured stoutly to supply the demand always in the mouths of&nbsp; voracious youth--<U+2018>More stories; more right away!<U+2019> Her family objected to&nbsp; this devotion at their expense, and her health suffered; but for a time&nbsp; she gratefully offered herself up on the altar of juvenile literature,&nbsp; feeling that she owed a good deal to the little friends in whose sight&nbsp; she had found favour after twenty years of effort.&nbsp; &nbsp; But a time came when her patience gave out; and wearying of being a&nbsp; lion, she became a bear in nature as in name, and returning to her den,&nbsp; growled awfully when ordered out. Her family enjoyed the fun, and had&nbsp; small sympathy with her trials, but Jo came to consider it the worse&nbsp; scrape of her life; for liberty had always been her dearest possession,&nbsp; and it seemed to be fast going from her. Living in a lantern soon loses&nbsp; its charm, and she was too old, too tired, and too busy to like it. She&nbsp; felt that she had done all that could reasonably be required of her when&nbsp; autographs, photographs, and autobiographical sketches had been sown&nbsp; broadcast over the land; when artists had taken her home in all its&nbsp; aspects, and reporters had taken her in the grim one she always&nbsp; assumed on these trying occasions; when a series of enthusiastic&nbsp; boarding-schools had ravaged her grounds for trophies, and a steady&nbsp; stream of amiable pilgrims had worn her doorsteps with their respectful&nbsp; feet; when servants left after a week<U+2019>s trial of the bell that rang all&nbsp; day; when her husband was forced to guard her at meals, and the boys&nbsp; to cover her retreat out of back windows on certain occasions when&nbsp; enterprising guests walked in unannounced at unfortunate moments.&nbsp; &nbsp; A sketch of one day may perhaps explain the state of things, offer some&nbsp; excuse for the unhappy woman, and give a hint to the autograph-fiend now&nbsp; rampant in the land; for it is a true tale.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>There ought to be a law to protect unfortunate authors,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo&nbsp; one morning soon after Emil<U+2019>s arrival, when the mail brought her an&nbsp; unusually large and varied assortment of letters. <U+2018>To me it is a more&nbsp; vital subject than international copyright; for time is money, peace is&nbsp; health, and I lose both with no return but less respect for my fellow&nbsp; creatures and a wild desire to fly into the wilderness, since I cannot&nbsp; shut my doors even in free America.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Lion-hunters are awful when in search of their prey. If they could&nbsp; change places for a while it would do them good; and they<U+2019>d see what&nbsp; bores they were when they <U+201C>do themselves the honour of calling to&nbsp; express their admiration of our charming work<U+201D>,<U+2019> quoted Ted, with a bow&nbsp; to his parent, now frowning over twelve requests for autographs.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have made up my mind on one point,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo with great firmness.&nbsp; <U+2018>I will not answer this kind of letter. I<U+2019>ve sent at least six to this&nbsp; boy, and he probably sells them. This girl writes from a seminary, and&nbsp; if I send her one all the other girls will at once write for more. All&nbsp; begin by saying they know they intrude, and that I am of course annoyed&nbsp; by these requests; but they venture to ask because I like boys, or they&nbsp; like the books, or it is only one. Emerson and Whittier put these things&nbsp; in the wastepaper-basket; and though only a literary nursery-maid&nbsp; who provides moral pap for the young, I will follow their illustrious&nbsp; example; for I shall have no time to eat or sleep if I try to satisfy&nbsp; these dear unreasonable children<U+2019>; and Mrs Jo swept away the entire&nbsp; batch with a sigh of relief.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll open the others and let you eat your breakfast in peace, liebe&nbsp; Mutter,<U+2019> said Rob, who often acted as her secretary. <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s one from&nbsp; the South<U+2019>; and breaking an imposing seal, he read:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>MADAM, As it has pleased Heaven to bless your efforts with a large&nbsp; fortune, I feel no hesitation in asking you to supply funds to purchase&nbsp; a new communion-service for our church. To whatever denomination you&nbsp; belong, you will of course respond with liberality to such a request,&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Respectfully yours,&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>MRS X.Y. ZAVIER<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Send a civil refusal, dear. All I have to give must go to feed and&nbsp; clothe the poor at my gates. That is my thank-offering for success. Go&nbsp; on,<U+2019> answered his mother, with a grateful glance about her happy home.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A literary youth of eighteen proposes that you put your name to a novel&nbsp; he has written; and after the first edition your name is to be taken off&nbsp; and his put on. There<U+2019>s a cool proposal for you. I guess you won<U+2019>t agree&nbsp; to that, in spite of your soft-heartedness towards most of the young&nbsp; scribblers.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Couldn<U+2019>t be done. Tell him so kindly, and don<U+2019>t let him send the&nbsp; manuscript. I have seven on hand now, and barely time to read my own,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Mrs Jo, pensively fishing a small letter out of the slop-bowl and&nbsp; opening it with care, because the down-hill address suggested that a&nbsp; child wrote it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will answer this myself. A little sick girl wants a book, and she&nbsp; shall have it, but I can<U+2019>t write sequels to all the rest to please her.&nbsp; I should never come to an end if I tried to suit these voracious little&nbsp; Oliver Twists, clamouring for more. What next, Robin?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This is short and sweet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>DEAR MRS BHAER, I am now going to give you my opinion of your works.&nbsp; I have read them all many times, and call them first-rate. Please go&nbsp; ahead.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Your admirer,&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>BILLY BABCOCK<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now that is what I like. Billy is a man of sense and a critic worth&nbsp; having, since he had read my works many times before expressing his&nbsp; opinion. He asks for no answer, so send my thanks and regards.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s a lady in England with seven girls, and she wishes to know your&nbsp; views upon education. Also what careers they shall follow the oldest&nbsp; being twelve. Don<U+2019>t wonder she<U+2019>s worried,<U+2019> laughed Rob.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll try to answer it. But as I have no girls, my opinion isn<U+2019>t worth&nbsp; much and will probably shock her, as I shall tell her to let them run&nbsp; and play and build up good, stout bodies before she talks about careers.&nbsp; They will soon show what they want, if they are let alone, and not all&nbsp; run in the same mould.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s a fellow who wants to know what sort of a girl he shall marry,&nbsp; and if you know of any like those in your stories.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Give him Nan<U+2019>s address, and see what he<U+2019>ll get,<U+2019> proposed Ted,&nbsp; privately resolving to do it himself if possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This is from a lady who wants you to adopt her child and lend her money&nbsp; to study art abroad for a few years. Better take it, and try your hand&nbsp; at a girl, mother.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, thank you, I will keep to my own line of business. What is that&nbsp; blotted one? It looks rather awful, to judge by the ink,<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo,&nbsp; who beguiled her daily task by trying to guess from the outside what&nbsp; was inside her many letters. This proved to be a poem from an insane&nbsp; admirer, to judge by its incoherent style.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          <U+2018>TO J.M.B.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Oh, were I a heliotrope,&nbsp;      I would play poet,&nbsp;      And blow a breeze of fragrance&nbsp;      To you; and none should know it.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Your form like the stately elm&nbsp;      When Phoebus gilds the morning ray;&nbsp;      Your cheeks like the ocean bed&nbsp;      That blooms a rose in May.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Your words are wise and bright,&nbsp;      I bequeath them to you a legacy given;&nbsp;      And when your spirit takes its flight,&nbsp;      May it bloom aflower in heaven.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>My tongue in flattering language spoke,&nbsp;      And sweeter silence never broke&nbsp;      in busiest street or loneliest glen.&nbsp;      I take you with the flashes of my pen.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Consider the lilies, how they grow;&nbsp;      They toil not, yet are fair,&nbsp;      Gems and flowers and Solomon<U+2019>s seal.&nbsp;      The geranium of the world is J. M. Bhaer.&nbsp; &nbsp;         <U+2018>JAMES<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While the boys shouted over this effusion--which is a true one--their&nbsp; mother read several liberal offers from budding magazines for her to&nbsp; edit them gratis; one long letter from a young girl inconsolable because&nbsp; her favourite hero died, and <U+2018>would dear Mrs Bhaer rewrite the tale, and&nbsp; make it end good?<U+2019> another from an irate boy denied an autograph, who&nbsp; darkly foretold financial ruin and loss of favour if she did not&nbsp; send him and all other fellows who asked autographs, photographs, and&nbsp; auto-biographical sketches; a minister wished to know her religion;&nbsp; and an undecided maiden asked which of her two lovers she should marry.&nbsp; These samples will suffice to show a few of the claims made on a busy&nbsp; woman<U+2019>s time, and make my readers pardon Mrs Jo if she did not carefully&nbsp; reply to all.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That job is done. Now I will dust a bit, and then go to my work. I<U+2019>m&nbsp; all behind-hand, and serials can<U+2019>t wait; so deny me to everybody, Mary.&nbsp; I won<U+2019>t see Queen Victoria if she comes today.<U+2019> And Mrs Bhaer threw down&nbsp; her napkin as if defying all creation.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I hope the day will go well with thee, my dearest,<U+2019> answered her&nbsp; husband, who had been busy with his own voluminous correspondence. <U+2018>I&nbsp; will dine at college with Professor Plock, who is to visit us today. The&nbsp; Junglings can lunch on Parnassus; so thou shalt have a quiet time.<U+2019> And&nbsp; smoothing the worried lines out of her forehead with his good-bye kiss,&nbsp; the excellent man marched away, both pockets full of books, an old&nbsp; umbrella in one hand, and a bag of stones for the geology class in the&nbsp; other.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If all literary women had such thoughtful angels for husbands, they&nbsp; would live longer and write more. Perhaps that wouldn<U+2019>t be a blessing to&nbsp; the world though, as most of us write too much now,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, waving&nbsp; her feather duster to her spouse, who responded with flourishes of the&nbsp; umbrella as he went down the avenue.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob started for school at the same time, looking so much like him with&nbsp; his books and bag and square shoulders and steady air that his mother&nbsp; laughed as she turned away, saying heartily: <U+2018>Bless both my dear&nbsp; professors, for better creatures never lived!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil was already gone to his ship in the city; but Ted lingered to steal&nbsp; the address he wanted, ravage the sugar-bowl, and talk with <U+2018>Mum<U+2019>;&nbsp; for the two had great larks together. Mrs Jo always arranged her own&nbsp; parlour, refilled her vases, and gave the little touches that left it&nbsp; cool and neat for the day. Going to draw down the curtain, she beheld an&nbsp; artist sketching on the lawn, and groaned as she hastily retired to the&nbsp; back window to shake her duster.&nbsp; &nbsp; At that moment the bell rang and the sound of wheels was heard in the&nbsp; road.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll go; Mary lets <U+2018>em in<U+2019>; and Ted smoothed his hair as he made for&nbsp; the hall.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Can<U+2019>t see anyone. Give me a chance to fly upstairs,<U+2019> whispered Mrs Jo,&nbsp; preparing to escape. But before she could do so, a man appeared at the&nbsp; door with a card in his hand. Ted met him with a stern air, and his&nbsp; mother dodged behind the window-curtains to bide her time for escape.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I am doing a series of articles for the Saturday Tattler, and I&nbsp; called to see Mrs Bhaer the first of all,<U+2019> began the newcomer in the&nbsp; insinuating tone of his tribe, while his quick eyes were taking in all&nbsp; they could, experience having taught him to make the most of his time,&nbsp; as his visits were usually short ones.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mrs Bhaer never sees reporters, sir.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But a few moments will be all I ask,<U+2019> said the man, edging his way&nbsp; farther in.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You can<U+2019>t see her, for she is out,<U+2019> replied Teddy, as a backward glance&nbsp; showed him that his unhappy parent had vanished--through the window, he&nbsp; supposed, as she sometimes did when hard bestead.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very sorry. I<U+2019>ll call again. Is this her study? Charming room!<U+2019> And the&nbsp; intruder fell back on the parlour, bound to see something and bag a fact&nbsp; if he died in the attempt. <U+2018>It is not,<U+2019> said Teddy, gently but firmly&nbsp; backing him down the hall, devoutly hoping that his mother had escaped&nbsp; round the corner of the house.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If you could tell me Mrs Bhaer<U+2019>s age and birthplace, date of marriage,&nbsp; and number of children, I should be much obliged,<U+2019> continued the&nbsp; unabashed visitor as he tripped over the door-mat.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She is about sixty, born in Nova Zembla, married just forty years ago&nbsp; today, and has eleven daughters. Anything else, sir?<U+2019> And Ted<U+2019>s sober&nbsp; face was such a funny contrast to his ridiculous reply that the reporter&nbsp; owned himself routed, and retired laughing just as a lady followed by&nbsp; three beaming girls came up the steps.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We are all the way from Oshkosh, and couldn<U+2019>t go home without seein<U+2019>&nbsp; dear Aunt Jo. My girls just admire her works, and lot on gettin<U+2019> a&nbsp; sight of her. I know it<U+2019>s early; but we are goin<U+2019> to see Holmes and&nbsp; Longfeller, and the rest of the celebrities, so we ran out here fust&nbsp; thing. Mrs Erastus Kingsbury Parmalee, of Oshkosh, tell her. We don<U+2019>t&nbsp; mind waitin<U+2019>; we can look round a spell if she ain<U+2019>t ready to see folks&nbsp; yet.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; All this was uttered with such rapidity that Ted could only stand&nbsp; gazing at the buxom damsels, who fixed their six blue eyes upon him so&nbsp; beseechingly that his native gallantry made it impossible to deny them a&nbsp; civil reply at least.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mrs Bhaer is not visible today--out just now, I believe; but you can&nbsp; see the house and grounds if you like,<U+2019> he murmured, falling back as the&nbsp; four pressed in gazing rapturously about them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, thank you! Sweet, pretty place I<U+2019>m sure! That<U+2019>s where she writes,&nbsp; ain<U+2019>t it? Do tell me if that<U+2019>s her picture! Looks just as I imagined&nbsp; her!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; With these remarks the ladies paused before a fine engraving of the Hon.&nbsp; Mrs Norton, with a pen in her hand and a rapt expression of countenance,&nbsp; likewise a diadem and pearl necklace.&nbsp; &nbsp; Keeping his gravity with an effort, Teddy pointed to a very bad portrait&nbsp; of Mrs Jo, which hung behind the door, and afforded her much amusement,&nbsp; it was so dismal, in spite of a curious effect of light upon the end of&nbsp; the nose and cheeks as red as the chair she sat in.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This was taken for my mother; but it is not very good,<U+2019> he said,&nbsp; enjoying the struggles of the girls not to look dismayed at the sad&nbsp; difference between the real and the ideal. The youngest, aged twelve,&nbsp; could not conceal her disappointment, and turned away, feeling as so&nbsp; many of us have felt when we discover that our idols are very ordinary&nbsp; men and women.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I thought she<U+2019>d be about sixteen and have her hair braided in two&nbsp; tails down her back. I don<U+2019>t care about seeing her now,<U+2019> said the honest&nbsp; child, walking off to the hall door, leaving her mother to apologize,&nbsp; and her sisters to declare that the bad portrait was <U+2018>perfectly lovely,&nbsp; so speaking and poetic, you know, <U+2018>specially about the brow<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come girls, we must be goin<U+2019>, if we want to get through today. You&nbsp; can leave your albums and have them sent when Mrs Bhaer has written a&nbsp; sentiment in <U+2018>em. We are a thousand times obliged. Give our best love&nbsp; to your ma, and tell her we are so sorry not to see her.<U+2019> Just as&nbsp; Mrs. Erastus Kingsbury Parmalee uttered the words her eye fell upon a&nbsp; middle-aged woman in a large checked apron, with a handkerchief tied&nbsp; over her head, busily dusting an end room which looked like a study.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>One peep at her sanctum since she is out,<U+2019> cried the enthusiastic lady,&nbsp; and swept across the hall with her flock before Teddy could warn his&nbsp; mother, whose retreat had been cut off by the artist in front, the&nbsp; reporter at the back of the house--for he hadn<U+2019>t gone and the ladies in&nbsp; the hall.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They<U+2019>ve got her!<U+2019> thought Teddy, in comical dismay. <U+2018>No use for her to&nbsp; play housemaid since they<U+2019>ve seen the portrait.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo did her best, and being a good actress, would have escaped if the&nbsp; fatal picture had not betrayed her. Mrs Parmalee paused at the desk, and&nbsp; regardless of the meerschaum that lay there, the man<U+2019>s slippers close&nbsp; by, and a pile of letters directed to <U+2018>Prof. F. Bhaer<U+2019>, she clasped her&nbsp; hands, exclaiming impressively: <U+2018>Girls, this is the spot where she wrote&nbsp; those sweet, those moral tales which have thrilled us to the soul! Could&nbsp; I--ah, could I take one morsel of paper, an old pen, a postage stamp&nbsp; even, as a memento of this gifted woman?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes<U+2019>m, help yourselves,<U+2019> replied the maid, moving away with a glance at&nbsp; the boy, whose eyes were now full of merriment he could not suppress.&nbsp; &nbsp; The oldest girl saw it, guessed the truth, and a quick look at the&nbsp; woman in the apron confirmed her suspicion. Touching her mother, she&nbsp; whispered: <U+2018>Ma, it<U+2019>s Mrs Bhaer herself. I know it is.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No? yes? it is! Well, I do declare, how nice that is!<U+2019> And hastily&nbsp; pursuing the unhappy woman, who was making for the door, Mrs Parmalee&nbsp; cried eagerly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t mind us! I know you<U+2019>re busy, but just let me take your hand and&nbsp; then we<U+2019>ll go.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Giving herself up for lost, Mrs Jo turned and presented her hand like&nbsp; a tea-tray, submitting to have it heartily shaken, as the matron said,&nbsp; with somewhat alarming hospitality:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If ever you come to Oshkosh, your feet won<U+2019>t be allowed to touch the&nbsp; pavement; for you<U+2019>ll be borne in the arms of the populace, we shall be&nbsp; so dreadful glad to see you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mentally resolving never to visit that effusive town, Jo responded&nbsp; as cordially as she could; and having written her name in the albums,&nbsp; provided each visitor with a memento, and kissed them all round, they at&nbsp; last departed, to call on <U+2018>Longfeller, Holmes, and the rest<U+2019>--who were&nbsp; all out, it is devoutly to be hoped.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You villain, why didn<U+2019>t you give me a chance to whip away? Oh, my dear,&nbsp; what fibs you told that man! I hope we shall be forgiven our sins in&nbsp; this line, but I don<U+2019>t know what is to become of us if we don<U+2019>t dodge.&nbsp; So many against one isn<U+2019>t fair play.<U+2019> And Mrs Jo hung up her apron in&nbsp; the hall closet, with a groan at the trials of her lot.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>More people coming up the avenue! Better dodge while the coast is&nbsp; clear! I<U+2019>ll head them off!<U+2019> cried Teddy, looking back from the steps, as&nbsp; he was departing to school.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo flew upstairs, and having locked her door, calmly viewed a young&nbsp; ladies<U+2019> seminary camp on the lawn, and being denied the house, proceed&nbsp; to enjoy themselves by picking the flowers, doing up their hair,&nbsp; eating lunch, and freely expressing their opinion of the place and its&nbsp; possessors before they went.&nbsp; &nbsp; A few hours of quiet followed, and she was just settling down to a long&nbsp; afternoon of hard work, when Rob came home to tell her that the Young&nbsp; Men<U+2019>s Christian Union would visit the college, and two or three of the&nbsp; fellows whom she knew wanted to pay their respects to her on the way.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is going to rain, so they won<U+2019>t come, I dare say; but father thought&nbsp; you<U+2019>d like to be ready, in case they do call. You always see the boys,&nbsp; you know, though you harden your heart to the poor girls,<U+2019> said Rob, who&nbsp; had heard from his brother about the morning visitations.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Boys don<U+2019>t gush, so I can stand it. The last time I let in a party of&nbsp; girls one fell into my arms and said, <U+201C>Darling, love me!<U+201D> I wanted to&nbsp; shake her,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, wiping her pen with energy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You may be sure the fellows won<U+2019>t do it, but they will want autographs,&nbsp; so you<U+2019>d better be prepared with a few dozen,<U+2019> said Rob, laying out a&nbsp; quire of notepaper, being a hospitable youth and sympathizing with those&nbsp; who admired his mother.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They can<U+2019>t outdo the girls. At X College I really believe I wrote&nbsp; three hundred during the day I was there, and I left a pile of cards and&nbsp; albums on my table when I came away. It is one of the most absurd and&nbsp; tiresome manias that ever afflicted the world.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless Mrs Jo wrote her name a dozen times, put on her black silk,&nbsp; and resigned herself to the impending call, praying for rain, however,&nbsp; as she returned to her work.&nbsp; &nbsp; The shower came, and feeling quite secure, she rumpled up her hair, took&nbsp; off her cuffs, and hurried to finish her chapter; for thirty pages a day&nbsp; was her task, and she liked to have it well done before evening. Josie&nbsp; had brought some flowers for the vases, and was just putting the last&nbsp; touches when she saw several umbrellas bobbing down the hill.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They are coming, Aunty! I see uncle hurrying across the field to&nbsp; receive them,<U+2019> she called at the stair-foot.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Keep an eye on them, and let me know when they enter the avenue.&nbsp; It will take but a minute to tidy up and run down,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo,&nbsp; scribbling away for dear life, because serials wait for no man, not even&nbsp; the whole Christian Union en masse.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>There are more than two or three. I see half a dozen at least,<U+2019> called&nbsp; sister Ann from the hall door. <U+2018>No! a dozen, I do believe; Aunty, look&nbsp; out; they are all coming! What shall we do?<U+2019> And Josie quailed at the&nbsp; idea of facing the black throng rapidly approaching.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mercy on us, there are hundreds! Run and put a tub in the back entry&nbsp; for their umbrellas to drip into. Tell them to go down the hall and&nbsp; leave them, and pile their hats on the table; the tree won<U+2019>t hold them&nbsp; all. No use to get mats; my poor carpets!<U+2019> And down went Mrs Jo to&nbsp; prepare for the invasion, while Josie and the maids flew about dismayed&nbsp; at the prospect of so many muddy boots.&nbsp; &nbsp; On they came, a long line of umbrellas, with splashed legs and flushed&nbsp; faces underneath; for the gentlemen had been having a good time all over&nbsp; the town, undisturbed by the rain. Professor Bhaer met them at the gate,&nbsp; and was making a little speech of welcome, when Mrs Jo, touched by their&nbsp; bedraggled state, appeared at the door, beckoning them in. Leaving&nbsp; their host to orate bareheaded in the wet, the young men hastened up the&nbsp; steps, merry, warm, and eager, clutching off their hats as they came,&nbsp; and struggling with their umbrellas, as the order was passed to march in&nbsp; and stack arms.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tramp, tramp, tramp, down the hall went seventy-five pairs of boots;&nbsp; soon seventy-five umbrellas dripped sociably in the hospitable tub,&nbsp; while their owners swarmed all over the lower part of the house; and&nbsp; seventy-five hearty hands were shaken by the hostess without a murmur,&nbsp; though some were wet, some very warm, and nearly all bore trophies of&nbsp; the day<U+2019>s ramble. One impetuous party flourished a small turtle as he&nbsp; made his compliments; another had a load of sticks cut from noted&nbsp; spots; and all begged for some memento of Plumfield. A pile of&nbsp; cards mysteriously appeared on the table, with a written request for&nbsp; autographs; and despite her morning vow, Mrs Jo wrote everyone, while&nbsp; her husband and boys did the honours of the house.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie fled to the back parlour, but was discovered by exploring youths,&nbsp; and mortally insulted by one of them, who innocently inquired if she was&nbsp; Mrs Bhaer. The reception did not last long, and the end was better than&nbsp; the beginning; for the rain ceased, and a rainbow shone beautifully&nbsp; over them as the good fellows stood upon the lawn singing sweetly for a&nbsp; farewell. A happy omen, that bow of promise arched over the young heads,&nbsp; as if Heaven smiled upon their union, and showed them that above the&nbsp; muddy earth and rainy skies the blessed sun still shone for all. Three&nbsp; cheers, and then away they went, leaving a pleasant recollection of&nbsp; their visit to amuse the family as they scraped the mud off the carpets&nbsp; with shovels and emptied the tub half-full of water.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Nice, honest, hard-working fellows, and I don<U+2019>t begrudge my half-hour&nbsp; at all; but I must finish, so don<U+2019>t let anyone disturb me till&nbsp; tea-time,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, leaving Mary to shut up the house; for papa and&nbsp; the boys had gone off with the guests, and Josie had run home to tell&nbsp; her mother about the fun at Aunt Jo<U+2019>s.&nbsp; &nbsp; Peace reigned for an hour, then the bell rang and Mary came giggling&nbsp; up to say: <U+2018>A queer kind of a lady wants to know if she can catch a&nbsp; grasshopper in the garden.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A what?<U+2019> cried Mrs Jo, dropping her pen with a blot; for of all the odd&nbsp; requests ever made, this was the oddest.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A grasshopper, ma<U+2019>am. I said you was busy, and asked what she wanted,&nbsp; and says she: <U+201C>I<U+2019>ve got grasshoppers from the grounds of several famous&nbsp; folks, and I want one from Plumfield to add to my collection.<U+201D> Did you&nbsp; ever?<U+2019> And Mary giggled again at the idea.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Tell her to take all there are and welcome. I shall be glad to get rid&nbsp; of them; always bouncing in my face and getting in my dress,<U+2019> laughed&nbsp; Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mary retired, to return in a moment nearly speechless with merriment.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She<U+2019>s much obliged, ma<U+2019>am, and she<U+2019>d like an old gown or a pair&nbsp; of stockings of yours to put in a rug she<U+2019>s making. Got a vest of&nbsp; Emerson<U+2019>s, she says, and a pair of Mr. Holmes<U+2019>s trousers, and a dress of&nbsp; Mrs Stowe<U+2019>s. She must be crazy!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Give her that old red shawl, then I shall make a gay show among the&nbsp; great ones in that astonishing rug. Yes, they are all lunatics, these&nbsp; lion-hunters; but this seems to be a harmless maniac, for she doesn<U+2019>t&nbsp; take my time, and gives me a good laugh,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, returning to her&nbsp; work after a glance from the window, which showed her a tall, thin lady&nbsp; in rusty black, skipping wildly to and fro on the lawn in pursuit of the&nbsp; lively insect she wanted.&nbsp; &nbsp; No more interruptions till the light began to fade, then Mary popped her&nbsp; head in to say a gentleman wished to see Mrs Bhaer, and wouldn<U+2019>t take no&nbsp; for an answer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He must. I shall not go down. This has been an awful day, and I won<U+2019>t&nbsp; be disturbed again,<U+2019> replied the harassed authoress, pausing in the&nbsp; midst of the grand finale of her chapter.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I told him so, ma<U+2019>am; but he walked right in as bold as brass. I guess&nbsp; he<U+2019>s another crazy one, and I declare I<U+2019>m <U+2018>most afraid of him, he<U+2019>s&nbsp; so big and black, and cool as cucumbers, though I will say he<U+2019>s&nbsp; good-looking,<U+2019> added Mary, with a simper; for the stranger had evidently&nbsp; found favour in her sight despite his boldness.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My day has been ruined, and I will have this last half-hour to finish.&nbsp; Tell him to go away; I won<U+2019>t go down,<U+2019> cried Mrs Jo, fiercely.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mary went; and listening, in spite of herself, her mistress heard first&nbsp; a murmur of voices, then a cry from Mary, and remembering the ways of&nbsp; reporters, also that her maid was both pretty and timid, Mrs Bhaer flung&nbsp; down her pen and went to the rescue. Descending with her most majestic&nbsp; air she demanded in an awe-inspiring voice, as she paused to survey the&nbsp; somewhat brigandish intruder, who seemed to be storming the staircase&nbsp; which Mary was gallantly defending:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Who is this person who insists on remaining when I have declined to see&nbsp; him?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m sure I don<U+2019>t know, ma<U+2019>am. He won<U+2019>t give no name, and says you<U+2019>ll&nbsp; be sorry if you don<U+2019>t see him,<U+2019> answered Mary, retiring flushed and&nbsp; indignant from her post.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Won<U+2019>t you be sorry?<U+2019> asked the stranger, looking up with a pair of&nbsp; black eyes full of laughter, the flash of white teeth through a long&nbsp; beard, and both hands out as he boldly approached the irate lady.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo gave one keen look, for the voice was familiar; then completed&nbsp; Mary<U+2019>s bewilderment by throwing both arms round the brigand<U+2019>s neck,&nbsp; exclaiming joyfully: <U+2018>My dearest boy, where did you come from?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>California, on purpose to see you, Mother Bhaer. Now won<U+2019>t you be sorry&nbsp; if I go away?<U+2019> answered Dan, with a hearty kiss.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>To think of my ordering you out of the house when I<U+2019>ve been longing to&nbsp; see you for a year,<U+2019> laughed Mrs Jo, and she went down to have a good&nbsp; talk with her returned wanderer, who enjoyed the joke immensely.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 4. DAN&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo often thought that Dan had Indian blood in him, not only because&nbsp; of his love of a wild, wandering life, but his appearance; for as he&nbsp; grew up, this became more striking. At twenty-five he was very tall,&nbsp; with sinewy limbs, a keen, dark face, and the alert look of one whose&nbsp; senses were all alive; rough in manner, full of energy, quick with word&nbsp; and blow, eyes full of the old fire, always watchful as if used to keep&nbsp; guard, and a general air of vigour and freshness very charming to&nbsp; those who knew the dangers and delights of his adventurous life. He was&nbsp; looking his best as he sat talking with <U+2018>Mother Bhaer<U+2019>, one strong brown&nbsp; hand in hers, and a world of affection in his voice as he said:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Forget old friends! How could I forget the only home I ever knew? Why,&nbsp; I was in such a hurry to come and tell my good luck that I didn<U+2019>t stop&nbsp; to fix up, you see; though I knew you<U+2019>d think I looked more like a wild&nbsp; buffalo than ever,<U+2019> with a shake of his shaggy black head, a tug at his&nbsp; beard, and a laugh that made the room ring.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I like it; I always had a fancy for banditti--and you look just like&nbsp; one. Mary, being a newcomer, was frightened at your looks and manners.&nbsp; Josie won<U+2019>t know you, but Ted will recognize his Danny in spite of the&nbsp; big beard and flowing mane. They will all be here soon to welcome you;&nbsp; so before they come tell me more about yourself. Why, Dan, dear! it<U+2019>s&nbsp; nearly two years since you were here! Has it gone well with you?<U+2019> asked&nbsp; Mrs Jo, who had been listening with maternal interest to his account of&nbsp; life in California, and the unexpected success of a small investment he&nbsp; had made.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>First-rate! I don<U+2019>t care for the money, you know. I only want a trifle&nbsp; to pay my way--rather earn as I go, and not be bothered with the care of&nbsp; a lot. It<U+2019>s the fun of the thing coming to me, and my being able to give&nbsp; away, that I like. No use to lay up; I shan<U+2019>t live to be old and need&nbsp; it,--my sort never do,<U+2019> said Dan, looking as if his little fortune&nbsp; rather oppressed him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But if you marry and settle somewhere, as I hope you will, you must&nbsp; have something to begin with, my son. So be prudent and invest your&nbsp; money; don<U+2019>t give it away, for rainy days come to all of us, and&nbsp; dependence would be very hard for you to bear,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo with a&nbsp; sage air, though she liked to see that the money-making fever had not&nbsp; seized her lucky boy yet.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan shook his head, and glanced about the room as if he already found it&nbsp; rather confined and longed for all out-of-doors again.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Who would marry a jack-o<U+2019>-lantern like me? Women like a steady-going&nbsp; man; I shall never be that.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My dear boy, when I was a girl I liked just such adventurous fellows&nbsp; as you are. Anything fresh and daring, free and romantic, is always&nbsp; attractive to us womenfolk. Don<U+2019>t be discouraged; you<U+2019>ll find an anchor&nbsp; some day, and be content to take shorter voyages and bring home a good&nbsp; cargo.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What should you say if I brought you an Indian squaw some day?<U+2019> asked&nbsp; Dan, with a glimmer of mischief in the eyes that rested on a marble bust&nbsp; of Galatea gleaming white and lovely in the corner.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Welcome her heartily, if she was a good one. Is there a prospect of&nbsp; it?<U+2019> and Mrs Jo peered at him with the interest which even literary&nbsp; ladies take in love affairs.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not at present, thank you. I<U+2019>m too busy <U+201C>to gallivant<U+201D>, as Ted calls&nbsp; it. How is the boy?<U+2019> asked Dan, skilfully turning the conversation, as&nbsp; if he had had enough of sentiment.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo was off at once, and expatiated upon the talents and virtues&nbsp; of her sons till they came bursting in and fell upon Dan like two&nbsp; affectionate young bears, finding a vent for their joyful emotions in a&nbsp; sort of friendly wrestling-match; in which both got worsted, of course,&nbsp; for the hunter soon settled them. The Professor followed, and tongues&nbsp; went like mill-clappers while Mary lighted up and cook devoted herself&nbsp; to an unusually good supper, instinctively divining that this guest was&nbsp; a welcome one.&nbsp; &nbsp; After tea Dan was walking up and down the long rooms as he talked, with&nbsp; occasional trips into the hall for a fresher breath of air, his lungs&nbsp; seeming to need more than those of civilized people. In one of these&nbsp; trips he saw a white figure framed in the dark doorway, and paused to&nbsp; look at it. Bess paused also, not recognizing her old friend, and quite&nbsp; unconscious of the pretty picture she made standing, tall and slender,&nbsp; against the soft gloom of the summer night, with her golden hair like a&nbsp; halo round her head, and the ends of a white shawl blown out like wings&nbsp; by the cool wind sweeping through the hail. <U+2018>Is it Dan?<U+2019> she asked,&nbsp; coming in with a gracious smile and outstretched hand.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Looks like it; but I didn<U+2019>t know you, Princess. I thought it was a&nbsp; spirit,<U+2019> answered Dan, looking down at her with a curious softness and&nbsp; wonder in his face.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve grown very much, but two years have changed you entirely<U+2019>; and&nbsp; Bess looked up with girlish pleasure at the picturesque figure before&nbsp; her--for it was a decided contrast to the well-dressed people about her.&nbsp; &nbsp; Before they could say more, Josie rushed in, and, forgetfull of the&nbsp; newly acquired dignity of her teens, let Dan catch her up and kiss her&nbsp; like a child. Not till he set her down did he discover she also was&nbsp; changed, and exclaimed in comic dismay:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hallo! Why, you are growing up too! What am I going to do, with no&nbsp; young one to play with? Here<U+2019>s Ted going it like a beanstalk, and Bess a&nbsp; young lady, and even you, my mustard-seed, letting down your frocks and&nbsp; putting on airs.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The girls laughed, and Josie blushed as she stared at the tall man,&nbsp; conscious that she had leaped before she looked. They made a pretty&nbsp; contrast, these two young cousins--one as fair as a lily, the other&nbsp; a little wild rose. And Dan gave a nod of satisfaction as he surveyed&nbsp; them; for he had seen many bonny girls in his travels, and was glad that&nbsp; these old friends were blooming so beautifully.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Here! we can<U+2019>t allow any monopoly of Dan!<U+2019> called Mrs Jo. <U+2018>Bring him&nbsp; back and keep an eye on him, or he will be slipping off for another&nbsp; little run of a year or two before we have half seen him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Led by these agreeable captors, Dan returned to the parlour to receive a&nbsp; scolding from Josie for getting ahead of all the other boys and looking&nbsp; like a man first.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Emil is older; but he<U+2019>s only a boy, and dances jigs and sings sailor&nbsp; songs just as he used to. You look about thirty, and as big and black&nbsp; as a villain in a play. Oh, I<U+2019>ve got a splendid idea! You are just the&nbsp; thing for Arbaces in The Last Days of Pompeii. We want to act it; have&nbsp; the lion and the gladiators and the eruption. Tom and Ted are going to&nbsp; shower bushels of ashes down and roll barrels of stones about. We wanted&nbsp; a dark man for the Egyptian; and you will be gorgeous in red and white&nbsp; shawls. Won<U+2019>t he, Aunt Jo?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; This deluge of words made Dan clap his hands over his ears; and before&nbsp; Mrs Bhaer could answer her impetuous niece the Laurences, with Meg and&nbsp; her family, arrived, soon followed by Tom and Nan, and all sat down to&nbsp; listen to Dan<U+2019>s adventures--told in brief yet effective manner, as the&nbsp; varying expressions of interest, wonder, merriment, and suspense painted&nbsp; on the circle of faces round him plainly showed. The boys all wanted to&nbsp; start at once for California and make fortunes; the girls could hardly&nbsp; wait for the curious and pretty things he had picked up for them in his&nbsp; travels; while the elders rejoiced heartily over the energy and good&nbsp; prospects of their wild boy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Of course you will want to go back for another stroke of luck; and I&nbsp; hope you will have it. But speculation is a dangerous game, and you may&nbsp; lose all you<U+2019>ve won,<U+2019> said Mr Laurie, who had enjoyed the stirring tale&nbsp; as much as any of the boys, and would have liked to rough it with Dan as&nbsp; well as they.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve had enough of it, for a while at least; too much like gambling.&nbsp; The excitement is all I care for, and it isn<U+2019>t good for me. I have a&nbsp; notion to try farming out West. It<U+2019>s grand on a large scale; and I feel&nbsp; as if steady work would be rather jolly after loafing round so long. I&nbsp; can make a beginning, and you can send me your black sheep to stock my&nbsp; place with. I tried sheep-farming in Australia, and know something about&nbsp; black ones, any way.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; A laugh chased away the sober look in Dan<U+2019>s face as he ended; and those&nbsp; who knew him best guessed that he had learned a lesson there in San&nbsp; Francisco, and dared not try again.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That is a capital idea, Dan!<U+2019> cried Mrs Jo, seeing great hope in this&nbsp; desire to fix himself somewhere and help others. <U+2018>We shall know where&nbsp; you are, and can go and see you, and not have half the world between us.&nbsp; I<U+2019>ll send my Ted for a visit. He<U+2019>s such a restless spirit, it would&nbsp; do him good. With you he would be safe while he worked off his surplus&nbsp; energies and learned a wholesome business.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll use the <U+201C>shubble and de hoe<U+201D> like a good one, if I get a chance&nbsp; out there; but the Speranza mines sound rather jollier,<U+2019> said Ted,&nbsp; examining the samples of ore Dan had brought for the Professor.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You go and start a new town, and when we are ready to swarm we will&nbsp; come out and settle there. You will want a newspaper very soon, and I&nbsp; like the idea of running one myself much better than grinding away as&nbsp; I do now,<U+2019> observed Demi, panting to distinguish himself in the&nbsp; journalistic line.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We could easily plant a new college there. These sturdy Westerners are&nbsp; hungry for learning, and very quick to see and choose the best,<U+2019> added&nbsp; ever-young Mr March, beholding with his prophetic eye many duplicates of&nbsp; their own flourishing establishment springing up in the wide West.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Go on, Dan. It is a fine plan, and we will back you up. I shouldn<U+2019>t&nbsp; mind investing in a few prairies and cowboys myself,<U+2019> said Mr Laurie,&nbsp; always ready to help the lads to help themselves, both by his cheery&nbsp; words and ever-open purse.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A little money sort of ballasts a fellow, and investing it in land&nbsp; anchors him--for a while, at least. I<U+2019>d like to see what I can do, but&nbsp; I thought I<U+2019>d consult you before I decided. Have my doubts about it&nbsp; suiting me for many years; but I can cut loose when I<U+2019>m tired,<U+2019> answered&nbsp; Dan, both touched and pleased at the eager interest of these friends in&nbsp; his plans.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know you won<U+2019>t like it. After having the whole world to roam over,&nbsp; one farm will seem dreadfully small and stupid,<U+2019> said Josie, who much&nbsp; preferred the romance of the wandering life which brought her thrilling&nbsp; tales and pretty things at each return.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Is there any art out there?<U+2019> asked Bess, thinking what a good study in&nbsp; black and white Dan would make as he stood talking, half turned from the&nbsp; light.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Plenty of nature, dear; and that is better. You will find splendid&nbsp; animals to model, and scenery such as you never saw in Europe to paint.&nbsp; Even prosaic pumpkins are grand out there. You can play Cinderella in&nbsp; one of them, Josie, when you open your theatre in Dansville,<U+2019> said Mr&nbsp; Laurie, anxious that no cold water should be thrown on the new plan.&nbsp; &nbsp; Stage-struck Josie was caught at once, and being promised all the tragic&nbsp; parts on the yet unbuilt stage, she felt a deep interest in the project&nbsp; and begged Dan to lose no time in beginning his experiment. Bess also&nbsp; confessed that studies from nature would be good for her, and wild&nbsp; scenery improve her taste, which might grow over-nice if only the&nbsp; delicate and beautiful were set before her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I speak for the practice of the new town,<U+2019> said Nan, always eager&nbsp; for fresh enterprises. <U+2018>I shall be ready by the time you get well&nbsp; started--towns grow so fast out there.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dan isn<U+2019>t going to allow any woman under forty in his place. He doesn<U+2019>t&nbsp; like them, <U+2018>specially young and pretty ones,<U+2019> put in Tom, who was raging&nbsp; with jealousy, because he read admiration for Nan in Dan<U+2019>s eyes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That won<U+2019>t affect me, because doctors are exceptions to all rules.&nbsp; There won<U+2019>t be much sickness in Dansville, everyone will lead such&nbsp; active, wholesome lives, and only energetic young people will go there.&nbsp; But accidents will be frequent, owing to wild cattle, fast riding,&nbsp; Indian scrimmages, and the recklessness of Western life. That will just&nbsp; suit me. I long for broken bones, surgery is so interesting and I get so&nbsp; little here,<U+2019> answered Nan, yearning to put out her shingle and begin.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll have you, Doctor, and be glad of such a good sample of what we can&nbsp; do in the East. Peg away, and I<U+2019>ll send for you as soon as I have a roof&nbsp; to cover you. I<U+2019>ll scalp a few red fellows or smash up a dozen or so of&nbsp; cowboys for your special benefit,<U+2019> laughed Dan, well pleased with the&nbsp; energy and fine physique which made Nan a conspicuous figure among other&nbsp; girls.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thanks. I<U+2019>ll come. Would you just let me feel your arm? Splendid&nbsp; biceps! Now, boys, see here: this is what I call muscle.<U+2019> And Nan&nbsp; delivered a short lecture with Dan<U+2019>s sinewy arm to illustrate it. Tom&nbsp; retired to the alcove and glowered at the stars, while he swung his own&nbsp; right arm with a vigour suggestive of knocking someone down.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Make Tom sexton; he<U+2019>ll enjoy burying the patients Nan kills. He<U+2019>s&nbsp; trying to get up the glum expression proper to the business. Don<U+2019>t&nbsp; forget him, Dan,<U+2019> said Ted, directing attention to the blighted being in&nbsp; the corner.&nbsp; &nbsp; But Tom never sulked long, and came out from his brief eclipse with the&nbsp; cheerful proposition:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Look here, we<U+2019>ll get the city to ship out to Dansville all the cases of&nbsp; yellow fever, smallpox, and cholera that arrive; then Nan will be happy&nbsp; and her mistakes won<U+2019>t matter much with emigrants and convicts.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I should advise settling near Jacksonville, or some such city, that you&nbsp; might enjoy the society of cultivated persons. The Plato Club is there,&nbsp; and a most ardent thirst for philosophy. Everything from the East is&nbsp; welcomed hospitably, and new enterprises would flourish in such kindly&nbsp; soil,<U+2019> observed Mr March, mildly offering a suggestion, as he sat among&nbsp; the elders enjoying the lively scene.&nbsp; &nbsp; The idea of Dan studying Plato was very funny; but no one except naughty&nbsp; Ted smiled, and Dan made haste to unfold another plan seething in that&nbsp; active brain of his.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m not sure the farming will succeed, and have a strong leaning&nbsp; towards my old friends the Montana Indians. They are a peaceful tribe,&nbsp; and need help awfully; hundreds have died of starvation because they&nbsp; don<U+2019>t get their share. The Sioux are fighters, thirty thousand strong,&nbsp; so Government fears <U+2018>em, and gives <U+2018>em all they want. I call that a&nbsp; damned shame!<U+2019> Dan stopped short as the oath slipped out, but his eyes&nbsp; flashed, and he went on quickly: <U+2018>It is just that, and I won<U+2019>t beg&nbsp; pardon. If I<U+2019>d had any money when I was there I<U+2019>d have given every cent&nbsp; to those poor devils, cheated out of everything, and waiting patiently,&nbsp; after being driven from their own land to places where nothing will&nbsp; grow. Now, honest agents could do much, and I<U+2019>ve a feeling that I ought&nbsp; to go and lend a hand. I know their lingo, and I like <U+2018>em. I<U+2019>ve got a&nbsp; few thousands, and I ain<U+2019>t sure I have any right to spend it on myself&nbsp; and settle down to enjoy it. Hey?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan looked very manly and earnest as he faced his friends, flushed and&nbsp; excited by the energy of his words; and all felt that little thrill of&nbsp; sympathy which links hearts together by the tie of pity for the wronged.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do it, do it!<U+2019> cried Mrs Jo, fired at once; for misfortune was much&nbsp; more interesting to her than good luck.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do it, do it!<U+2019> echoed Ted, applauding as if at a play, <U+2018>and take me&nbsp; along to help. I<U+2019>m just raging to get among those fine fellows and&nbsp; hunt.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let us hear more and see if it is wise,<U+2019> said Mr Laurie, privately&nbsp; resolving to people his as yet unbought prairies with Montana Indians,&nbsp; and increase his donations to the society that sent missionaries to this&nbsp; much wronged people.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan plunged at once into the history of what he saw among the Dakotas,&nbsp; and other tribes in the Northwest, telling of their wrongs, patience,&nbsp; and courage as if they were his brothers.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They called me Dan Fire Cloud, because my rifle was the best they ever&nbsp; saw. And Black Hawk was as good a friend as a fellow would want; saved&nbsp; my life more than once, and taught me just what will be useful if I go&nbsp; back. They are down on their luck, now, and I<U+2019>d like to pay my debts.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; By this time everyone was interested, and Dansville began to lose its&nbsp; charm. But prudent Mr Bhaer suggested that one honest agent among many&nbsp; could not do much, and noble as the effort would be, it was wiser to&nbsp; think over the matter carefully, get influence and authority from the&nbsp; right quarters, and meantime look at lands before deciding.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, I will. I<U+2019>m going to take a run to Kansas and see how that&nbsp; promises. Met a fellow in <U+2018>Frisco who<U+2019>d been there, and he spoke well&nbsp; of it. The fact is, there<U+2019>s so much to be done every where that I don<U+2019>t&nbsp; know where to catch on, and half wish I hadn<U+2019>t any money,<U+2019> answered Dan,&nbsp; knitting his brows in the perplexity all kind souls feel when anxious to&nbsp; help at the great task of the world<U+2019>s charity.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll keep it for you till you decide. You are such an impetuous lad&nbsp; you<U+2019>ll give it to the first beggar that gets hold of you. I<U+2019>ll turn it&nbsp; over while you are prospecting, and hand it back when you are ready to&nbsp; invest, shall I?<U+2019> asked Mr Laurie, who had learned wisdom since the days&nbsp; of his own extravagant youth.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thanky, sir, I<U+2019>d be glad to get rid of it. You just hold on till I say&nbsp; the word; and if anything happens to me this time, keep it to help some&nbsp; other scamp as you helped me. This is my will, and you all witness it.&nbsp; Now I feel better.<U+2019> And Dan squared his shoulders as if relieved of&nbsp; a burden, after handing over the belt in which he carried his little&nbsp; fortune.&nbsp; &nbsp; No one dreamed how much was to happen before Dan came to take his money&nbsp; back, nor how nearly that act was his last will and testament; and while&nbsp; Mr Laurie was explaining how he would invest it, a cheery voice was&nbsp; heard singing:&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Oh, Peggy was a jolly lass,&nbsp;      Ye heave ho, boys, ye heave ho!&nbsp;      She never grudged her Jack a glass,&nbsp;      Ye heave ho, boys, ye heave ho!&nbsp;      And when he sailed the raging main,&nbsp;      She faithful was unto her swain,&nbsp;      Ye heave ho, boys, ye heave ho!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil always announced his arrival in that fashion, and in a moment he&nbsp; came hurrying in with Nat, who had been giving lessons in town all day.&nbsp; It was good to see the latter beam at his friend as he nearly shook his&nbsp; hand off; better still to see how Dan gratefully remembered all he owed&nbsp; Nat, and tried to pay the debt in his rough way; and best of all to&nbsp; hear the two travellers compare notes and reel off yarns to dazzle the&nbsp; land-lubbers and home-keepers.&nbsp; &nbsp; After this addition the house would not contain the gay youngsters, so&nbsp; they migrated to the piazza and settled on the steps, like a flock of&nbsp; night-loving birds. Mr March and the Professor retired to the study, Meg&nbsp; and Amy went to look after the little refection of fruit and cake which&nbsp; was to come, and Mrs Jo and Mr Laurie sat in the long window listening&nbsp; to the chat that went on outside.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>There they are, the flower of our flock!<U+2019> she said, pointing to the&nbsp; group before them. <U+2018>The others are dead or scattered, but these seven&nbsp; boys and four girls are my especial comfort and pride. Counting Alice&nbsp; Heath, my dozen is made up, and my hands are full trying to guide these&nbsp; young lives as far as human skill can do it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>When we remember how different they are, from what some of them came,&nbsp; and the home influences about others, I think we may feel pretty well&nbsp; satisfied so far,<U+2019> answered Mr Laurie soberly, as his eyes rested on&nbsp; one bright head among the black and brown ones, for the young moon shone&nbsp; alike on all.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t worry about the girls; Meg sees to them, and is so wise and&nbsp; patient and tender they can<U+2019>t help doing well; but my boys are more care&nbsp; every year, and seem to drift farther away from me each time they go,<U+2019>&nbsp; sighed Mrs Jo. <U+2018>They will grow up, and I can only hold them by one&nbsp; little thread, which may snap at any time, as it has with Jack and Ned.&nbsp; Dolly and George still like to come back, and I can say my word to them;&nbsp; and dear old Franz is too true ever to forget his own. But the three&nbsp; who are soon going out into the world again I can<U+2019>t help worrying about.&nbsp; Emil<U+2019>s good heart will keep him straight, I hope, and&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018><U+201C>A sweet little cherub sits up aloft,&nbsp;     To look out for the life of poor Jack.<U+201D><U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nat is to make his first flight, and he<U+2019>s weak in spite of your&nbsp; strengthening influence; and Dan is still untamed. I fear it will take&nbsp; some hard lesson to do that.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He<U+2019>s a fine fellow, Jo, and I almost regret this farming project. A&nbsp; little polish would make a gentleman of him, and who knows what he might&nbsp; become here among us,<U+2019> answered Mr Laurie, leaning over Mrs Bhaer<U+2019>s&nbsp; chair, just as he used to do years ago when they had mischievous secrets&nbsp; together.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It wouldn<U+2019>t be safe, Teddy. Work and the free life he loves will make a&nbsp; good man of him, and that is better than any amount of polish, with&nbsp; the dangers an easy life in a city would bring him. We can<U+2019>t change his&nbsp; nature--only help it to develop in the right direction. The old impulses&nbsp; are there, and must be controlled, or he will go wrong. I see that; but&nbsp; his love for us is a safeguard, and we must keep a hold on him till he&nbsp; is older or has a stronger tie to help him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo spoke earnestly, for, knowing Dan better than anyone else, she&nbsp; saw that her colt was not thoroughly broken yet, and feared while she&nbsp; hoped, knowing that life would always be hard for one like him. She was&nbsp; sure that before he went away again, in some quiet moment he would give&nbsp; her a glimpse of his inner self, and then she could say the word of&nbsp; warning or encouragement that he needed. So she bided her time, studying&nbsp; him meanwhile, glad to see all that was promising, and quick to detect&nbsp; the harm the world was doing him. She was very anxious to make a success&nbsp; of her <U+2018>firebrand<U+2019> because others predicted failure; but having learned&nbsp; that people cannot be moulded like clay, she contented herself with the&nbsp; hope that this neglected boy might become a good man, and asked no more.&nbsp; Even that was much to expect, so full was he of wayward impulses, strong&nbsp; passions, and the lawless nature born in him. Nothing held him but&nbsp; the one affection of his life--the memory of Plumfield, the fear&nbsp; of disappointing these faithful friends, the pride, stronger than&nbsp; principle, that made him want to keep the regard of the mates who always&nbsp; had admired and loved him in spite of all his faults.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t fret, old dear; Emil is one of the happy-go-lucky sort who always&nbsp; fall on their legs. I<U+2019>ll see to Nat, and Dan is in a good way now. Let&nbsp; him take a look at Kansas, and if the farm plan loses its charm, he&nbsp; can fall back on poor Lo, and really do good out there. He<U+2019>s unusually&nbsp; fitted for that peculiar task and I hope he<U+2019>ll decide to do it. Fighting&nbsp; oppressors, and befriending the oppressed will keep those dangerous&nbsp; energies of his busy, and the life will suit him better than sheep-folds&nbsp; and wheat-fields.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I hope so. What is that?<U+2019> and Mrs Jo leaned forward to listen, as&nbsp; exclamations from Ted and Josie caught her ear.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A mustang! a real, live one; and we can ride it. Dan, you are a&nbsp; first-class trump!<U+2019> cried the boy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A whole Indian dress for me! Now I can play Namioka, if the boys act&nbsp; Metamora,<U+2019> added Josie, clapping her hands.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A buffalo<U+2019>s head for Bess! Good gracious, Dan, why did you bring such a&nbsp; horrid thing as that to her?<U+2019> asked Nan.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thought it would do her good to model something strong and natural.&nbsp; She<U+2019>ll never amount to anything if she keeps on making namby-pamby gods&nbsp; and pet kittens,<U+2019> answered irreverent Dan, remembering that when he was&nbsp; last here Bess was vibrating distractedly between a head of Apollo and&nbsp; her Persian cat as models.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thank you; I<U+2019>ll try it, and if I fail we can put the buffalo up in the&nbsp; hall to remind us of you,<U+2019> said Bess, indignant at the insult offered&nbsp; the gods of her idolatry, but too well bred to show it except in her&nbsp; voice, which was as sweet and as cold as ice-cream.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I suppose you won<U+2019>t come out to see our new settlement when the rest&nbsp; do? Too rough for you?<U+2019> asked Dan, trying to assume the deferential air&nbsp; all the boys used when addressing their Princess.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I am going to Rome to study for years. All the beauty and art of the&nbsp; world is there, and a lifetime isn<U+2019>t long enough to enjoy it,<U+2019> answered&nbsp; Bess.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Rome is a mouldy old tomb compared to the <U+201C>Garden of the gods<U+201D> and my&nbsp; magnificent Rockies. I don<U+2019>t care a hang for art; nature is as much as I&nbsp; can stand, and I guess I could show you things that would knock your old&nbsp; masters higher than kites. Better come, and while Josie rides the horses&nbsp; you can model <U+2018>em. If a drove of a hundred or so of wild ones can<U+2019>t show&nbsp; you beauty, I<U+2019>ll give up,<U+2019> cried Dan, waxing enthusiastic over the wild&nbsp; grace and vigour which he could enjoy but had no power to describe.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll come some day with papa, and see if they are better than the&nbsp; horses of St Mark and those on Capitol Hill. Please don<U+2019>t abuse my gods,&nbsp; and I will try to like yours,<U+2019> said Bess, beginning to think the West&nbsp; might be worth seeing, though no Raphael or Angelo had yet appeared&nbsp; there.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s a bargain! I do think people ought to see their own country&nbsp; before they go scooting off to foreign parts, as if the new world wasn<U+2019>t&nbsp; worth discovering,<U+2019> began Dan, ready to bury the hatchet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It has some advantages, but not all. The women of England can vote,&nbsp; and we can<U+2019>t. I<U+2019>m ashamed of America that she isn<U+2019>t ahead in all good&nbsp; things,<U+2019> cried Nan, who held advanced views on all reforms, and was&nbsp; anxious about her rights, having had to fight for some of them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, please don<U+2019>t begin on that. People always quarrel over that&nbsp; question, and call names, and never agree. Do let us be quiet and happy&nbsp; tonight,<U+2019> pleaded Daisy, who hated discussion as much as Nan loved it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You shall vote as much as you like in our new town, Nan; be mayor and&nbsp; aldermen, and run the whole concern. It<U+2019>s going to be as free as air,&nbsp; or I can<U+2019>t live in it,<U+2019> said Dan, adding, with a laugh, <U+2018>I see Mrs&nbsp; Giddygaddy and Mrs Shakespeare Smith don<U+2019>t agree any better than they&nbsp; used to.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If everyone agreed, we should never get on. Daisy is a dear, but&nbsp; inclined to be an old fogy; so I stir her up; and next fall she will go&nbsp; and vote with me. Demi will escort us to do the one thing we are allowed&nbsp; to do as yet.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Will you take <U+2018>em, Deacon?<U+2019> asked Dan, using the old name as if he&nbsp; liked it. <U+2018>It works capitally in Wyoming.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I shall be proud to do it. Mother and the aunts go every year, and&nbsp; Daisy will come with me. She is my better half still; and I don<U+2019>t mean&nbsp; to leave her behind in anything,<U+2019> said Demi, with an arm round his&nbsp; sister of whom he was fonder than ever.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan looked at them wistfully, thinking how sweet it must be to have such&nbsp; a tie; and his lonely youth seemed sadder than ever as he recalled its&nbsp; struggles. A gusty sigh from Tom made sentiment impossible, as he said&nbsp; pensively:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I always wanted to be a twin. It<U+2019>s so sociable and so cosy to have&nbsp; someone glad to lean on a fellow and comfort him, if other girls are&nbsp; cruel.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As Tom<U+2019>s unrequited passion was the standing joke of the family, this&nbsp; allusion produced a laugh, which Nan increased by whipping out a bottle&nbsp; of Nux, saying, with her professional air:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I knew you ate too much lobster for tea. Take four pellets, and your&nbsp; dyspepsia will be all right. Tom always sighs and is silly when he<U+2019>s&nbsp; overeaten.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll take <U+2018>em. These are the only sweet things you ever give me.<U+2019> And&nbsp; Tom gloomily crunched his dose.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018><U+201C>Who can minister to a mind diseased, or pluck out a rooted sorrow?<U+201D>&nbsp;  quoted Josie tragically from her perch on the railing.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come with me, Tommy, and I<U+2019>ll make a man of you. Drop your pills and&nbsp; powders, and cavort round the world a spell, and you<U+2019>ll soon forget&nbsp; you<U+2019>ve got a heart, or a stomach either,<U+2019> said Dan, offering his one&nbsp; panacea for all ills.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ship with me, Tom. A good fit of seasickness will set you up, and&nbsp; a stiff north-easter blow your blue-devils away. Come along as&nbsp; surgeon--easy berth, and no end of larks.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018><U+201C>And if your Nancy frowns, my lad,&nbsp;       And scorns a jacket blue,&nbsp;       Just hoist your sails for other ports,&nbsp;       And find a maid more true.<U+201D><U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; added Emil, who had a fragment of song to cheer every care and sorrow,&nbsp; and freely offered them to his friends.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Perhaps I<U+2019>ll think of it when I<U+2019>ve got my diploma. I<U+2019>m not going to&nbsp; grind three mortal years and have nothing to show for it. Till then,--<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll never desert Mrs Micawber,<U+2019> interrupted Teddy, with a gurgling&nbsp; sob. Tom immediately rolled him off the step into the wet grass below;&nbsp; and by the time this slight skirmish was over, the jingle of teaspoons&nbsp; suggested refreshments of a more agreeable sort. In former times the&nbsp; little girls waited on the boys, to save confusion; now the young men&nbsp; flew to serve the ladies, young and old; and that slight fact showed&nbsp; plainly how the tables were turned by time. And what a pleasant&nbsp; arrangement it was! Even Josie sat still, and let Emil bring her&nbsp; berries; enjoying her young lady-hood, till Ted stole her cake, when she&nbsp; forgot manners, and chastised him with a rap on the knuckles. As guest&nbsp; of honour, Dan was only allowed to wait on Bess, who still held the&nbsp; highest place in this small world. Tom carefully selected the best of&nbsp; everything for Nan, to be crushed by the remark:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I never eat at this hour; and you will have a nightmare if you do.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; So, dutifully curbing the pangs of hunger, he gave the plate to Daisy,&nbsp; and chewed rose-leaves for his supper.&nbsp; &nbsp; When a surprising quantity of wholesome nourishment had been consumed,&nbsp; someone said, <U+2018>Let<U+2019>s sing!<U+2019> and a tuneful hour followed. Nat fiddled,&nbsp; Demi piped, Dan strummed the old banjo, and Emil warbled a doleful&nbsp; ballad about the wreck of the Bounding Betsey; then everybody joined&nbsp; in the old songs till there was very decidedly <U+2018>music in the air<U+2019>; and&nbsp; passers-by said, as they listened smiling: <U+2018>Old Plum is gay tonight!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; When all had gone Dan lingered on the piazza, enjoying the balmy wind&nbsp; that blew up from the hayfields, and brought the breath of flowers from&nbsp; Parnassus; and as he leaned there romantically in the moonlight, Mrs Jo&nbsp; came to shut the door.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dreaming dreams, Dan?<U+2019> she asked, thinking the tender moment might have&nbsp; come. Imagine the shock when, instead of some interesting confidence or&nbsp; affectionate word, Dan swung round, saying bluntly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I was wishing I could smoke.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo laughed at the downfall of her hopes, and answered kindly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You may, in your room; but don<U+2019>t set the house afire.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps Dan saw a little disappointment in her face, or the memory of&nbsp; the sequel of that boyish frolic touched his heart; for he stooped and&nbsp; kissed her, saying in a whisper: <U+2018>Good night, mother.<U+2019> And Mrs Jo was&nbsp; half satisfied.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 5. VACATION&nbsp; &nbsp; Everyone was glad of a holiday next morning, and all lingered over the&nbsp; breakfast-table, till Mrs Jo suddenly exclaimed:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Why, there<U+2019>s a dog!<U+2019> And on the threshold of the door appeared a great&nbsp; deer-hound, standing motionless, with his eyes fixed on Dan.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hallo, old boy! Couldn<U+2019>t you wait till I came for you? Have you cut&nbsp; away on the sly? Own up now, and take your whipping like a man,<U+2019> said&nbsp; Dan, rising to meet the dog, who reared on his hind legs to look his&nbsp; master in the face and bark as if uttering an indignant denial of any&nbsp; disobedience.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>All right; Don never lies.<U+2019> And Dan gave the tall beast a hug, adding&nbsp; as he glanced out of the window, where a man and horse were seen&nbsp; approaching:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I left my plunder at the hotel over night, not knowing how I should&nbsp; find you. Come out and see Octoo, my mustang; she<U+2019>s a beauty.<U+2019> And Dan&nbsp; was off, with the family streaming after him, to welcome the newcomer.&nbsp; &nbsp; They found her preparing to go up the steps in her eagerness to reach&nbsp; her master, to the great dismay of the man, who was holding her back.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let her come,<U+2019> called Dan; <U+2018>she climbs like a cat and jumps like a&nbsp; deer. Well, my girl, do you want a gallop?<U+2019> he asked, as the pretty&nbsp; creature clattered up to him and whinnied with pleasure as he rubbed her&nbsp; nose and slapped her glossy flank.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s what I call a horse worth having,<U+2019> said Ted, full of admiration&nbsp; and delight; for he was to have the care of her during Dan<U+2019>s absence.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What intelligent eyes! She looks as if she would speak,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She talks like a human in her way. Very little that she don<U+2019>t know.&nbsp; Hey, old Lass?<U+2019> and Dan laid his cheek to hers as if the little black&nbsp; mare was very dear to him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What does <U+201C>Octoo<U+201D> mean?<U+2019> asked Rob.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Lightning; she deserves it, as you<U+2019>ll see. Black Hawk gave her to me&nbsp; for my rifle, and we<U+2019>ve had high times together out yonder. She<U+2019>s saved&nbsp; my life more than once. Do you see that scar?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan pointed to a small one, half hidden by the long mane; and standing&nbsp; with his arm about Octoo<U+2019>s neck, he told the story of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Black Hawk and I were after buffalo one time, but didn<U+2019>t find <U+2018>em as&nbsp; soon as we expected; so our food gave out, and there we were a hundred&nbsp; miles from Red Deer River, where our camp was. I thought we were done&nbsp; for, but my brave pal says: <U+201C>Now I<U+2019>ll show you how we can live till&nbsp; we find the herds.<U+201D> We were unsaddling for the night by a little pond;&nbsp; there wasn<U+2019>t a living creature in sight anywhere, not even a bird, and&nbsp; we could see for miles over the prairies. What do you think we did?<U+2019> And&nbsp; Dan looked into the faces round him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ate worms like the Australian fellows,<U+2019> said Rob. <U+2018>Boiled grass or&nbsp; leaves,<U+2019> added Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Perhaps filled the stomach with clay, as we read of savages doing?<U+2019>&nbsp; suggested Mr Bhaer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Killed one of the horses,<U+2019> cried Ted, eager for bloodshed of some sort.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No; but we bled one of them. See, just here; filled a tin cup, put some&nbsp; wild sage leaves in it, with water, and heated it over a fire of sticks.&nbsp; It was good, and we slept well.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I guess Octoo didn<U+2019>t.<U+2019> And Josie patted the animal, with a face full of&nbsp; sympathy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Never minded it a bit. Black Hawk said we could live on the horses&nbsp; several days and still travel before they felt it. But by another&nbsp; morning we found the buffalo, and I shot the one whose head is in my&nbsp; box, ready to hang up and scare brats into fits. He<U+2019>s a fierce old&nbsp; fellow, you bet.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What is this strap for?<U+2019> asked Ted, who was busily examining the Indian&nbsp; saddle, the single rein and snaffle, with lariat, and round the neck the&nbsp; leather band he spoke of.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We hold on to that when we lie along the horse<U+2019>s flank farthest from&nbsp; the enemy, and fire under the neck as we gallop round and round. I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; show you.<U+2019> And springing into the saddle, Dan was off down the steps,&nbsp; tearing over the lawn at a great pace, sometimes on Octoo<U+2019>s back,&nbsp; sometimes half hidden as he hung by stirrup and strap, and sometimes&nbsp; off altogether, running beside her as she loped along, enjoying the&nbsp; fun immensely; while Don raced after, in a canine rapture at being free&nbsp; again and with his mates.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a fine sight--the three wild things at play, so full of vigour,&nbsp; grace, and freedom, that for the moment the smooth lawn seemed a&nbsp; prairie; and the spectators felt as if this glimpse of another life made&nbsp; their own seem rather tame and colourless.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This is better than a circus!<U+2019> cried Mrs Jo, wishing she were a girl&nbsp; again, that she might take a gallop on this chained lightning of a&nbsp; horse. <U+2018>I foresee that Nan will have her hands full setting bones, for&nbsp; Ted will break every one of his trying to rival Dan.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A few falls will not harm, and this new care and pleasure will be good&nbsp; for him in all ways. But I fear Dan will never follow a plough after&nbsp; riding a Pegasus like that,<U+2019> answered Mr Bhaer, as the black mare leaped&nbsp; the gate and came flying up the avenue, to stop at a word and stand&nbsp; quivering with excitement, while Dan swung himself off and looked up for&nbsp; applause.&nbsp; &nbsp; He received plenty of it, and seemed more pleased for his pet<U+2019>s sake&nbsp; than for his own. Ted clamoured for a lesson at once, and was soon at&nbsp; ease in the queer saddle, finding Octoo gentle as a lamb, as he trotted&nbsp; away to show off at college. Bess came hastening down the hill, having&nbsp; seen the race from afar; and all collected on the piazza while Dan&nbsp; <U+2018>yanked<U+2019> the cover off the big box the express had <U+2018>dumped<U+2019> before the&nbsp; door--to borrow his own words.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan usually travelled in light marching order, and hated to have more&nbsp; luggage than he could carry in his well-worn valise. But now that he had&nbsp; a little money of his own, he had cumbered himself with a collection of&nbsp; trophies won by his bow and spear, and brought them home to bestow upon&nbsp; his friends.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We shall be devoured with moths,<U+2019> thought Mrs Jo, as the shaggy head&nbsp; appeared, followed by a wolf-skin rug for her feet, a bear-skin ditto&nbsp; for the Professor<U+2019>s study, and Indian garments bedecked with foxes<U+2019>&nbsp; tails for the boys.&nbsp; &nbsp; All nice and warm for a July day, but received with delight&nbsp; nevertheless. Ted and Josie immediately <U+2018>dressed up<U+2019>, learned the&nbsp; war-whoop, and proceeded to astonish their friends by a series of&nbsp; skirmishes about the house and grounds, with tomahawks and bows and&nbsp; arrows, till weariness produced a lull.&nbsp; &nbsp; Gay birds<U+2019> wings, plumy pampas grass, strings of wampum, and pretty work&nbsp; in beads, bark, and feathers, pleased the girls. Minerals, arrow-heads,&nbsp; and crude sketches interested the Professor; and when the box was empty,&nbsp; Dan gave Mr Laurie, as his gift, several plaintive Indian songs written&nbsp; on birch-bark.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We only want a tent over us to be quite perfect. I feel as if I ought&nbsp; to give you parched corn and dried meat for dinner, my braves. Nobody&nbsp; will want lamb and green peas after this splendid pow-wow,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo,&nbsp; surveying the picturesque confusion of the long hall, where people lay&nbsp; about on the rugs, all more or less bedecked with feathers, moccasins,&nbsp; or beads.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Moose noses, buffalo tongues, bear steaks, and roasted marrow-bones&nbsp; would be the thing, but I don<U+2019>t mind a change; so bring on your baa-baa&nbsp; and green meat,<U+2019> answered Dan from the box, where he sat in state like a&nbsp; chief among his tribe, with the great hound at his feet.&nbsp; &nbsp; The girls began to clear up, but made little headway; for everything&nbsp; they touched had a story, and all were thrilling, comical, or wild; so&nbsp; they found it hard to settle to their work, till Dan was carried off by&nbsp; Mr Laurie.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was the beginning of the summer holiday, and it was curious to see&nbsp; what a pleasant little stir Dan<U+2019>s and Emil<U+2019>s coming made in the quiet&nbsp; life of the studious community; for they seemed to bring a fresh breeze&nbsp; with them that enlivened everyone. Many of the collegians remained&nbsp; during vacation; and Plumfield and Parnassus did their best to make&nbsp; these days pleasant for them, since most came from distant States, were&nbsp; poor, and had few opportunities but this for culture or amusement. Emil&nbsp; was hail-fellow-well-met with men and maids, and went rollicking&nbsp; about in true sailor fashion; but Dan stood rather in awe of the <U+2018>fair&nbsp; girl-graduates<U+2019>, and was silent when among them, eyeing them as an eagle&nbsp; might a flock of doves. He got on better with the young men, and was&nbsp; their hero at once. Their admiration for his manly accomplishments did&nbsp; him good; because he felt his educational defects keenly, and often&nbsp; wondered if he could find anything in books to satisfy him as thoroughly&nbsp; as did the lessons he was learning from Nature<U+2019>s splendidly illustrated&nbsp; volume. In spite of his silence, the girls found out his good qualities,&nbsp; and regarded <U+2018>the Spaniard<U+2019>, as they named him, with great favour;&nbsp; for his black eyes were more eloquent than his tongue, and the kind&nbsp; creatures tried to show their friendly interests in many charming ways.&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw this, and endeavoured to be worthy of it--curbing his free&nbsp; speech, toning down his rough manners, and watching the effect of all he&nbsp; said and did, anxious to make a good impression. The social atmosphere&nbsp; warmed his lonely heart, the culture excited him to do his best, and the&nbsp; changes which had taken place during his absence, both in himself and&nbsp; others, made the old home seem like a new world. After the life in&nbsp; California, it was sweet and restful to be here, with these familiar&nbsp; faces round him, helping him to forget much that he regretted, and to&nbsp; resolve to deserve more entirely the confidence of these good fellows,&nbsp; the respect of these innocent girls.&nbsp; &nbsp; So there was riding, rowing, and picnicking by day, music, dancing, and&nbsp; plays by night; and everyone said there had not been so gay a vacation&nbsp; for years. Bess kept her promise, and let the dust gather on her beloved&nbsp; clay while she went pleasuring with her mates or studied music with her&nbsp; father, who rejoiced over the fresh roses in her cheeks and the laughter&nbsp; which chased away the dreamy look she used to wear. Josie quarrelled&nbsp; less with Ted; for Dan had a way of looking at her which quelled her&nbsp; instantly, and had almost as good an effect upon her rebellious cousin.&nbsp; But Octoo did even more for the lively youth, who found that her charms&nbsp; entirely eclipsed those of the bicycle which had been his heart<U+2019>s&nbsp; delight before. Early and late he rode this untiring beast, and began&nbsp; to gain flesh--to the great joy of his mother, who feared that her&nbsp; beanstalk was growing too fast for health.&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi, finding business dull, solaced his leisure by photographing&nbsp; everybody he could induce to sit or stand to him, producing some&nbsp; excellent pictures among many failures; for he had a pretty taste in&nbsp; grouping, and endless patience. He might be said to view the world&nbsp; through the lens of his camera, and seemed to enjoy himself very much&nbsp; squinting at his fellow beings from under a bit of black cambric. Dan&nbsp; was a treasure to him; for he took well, and willingly posed in his&nbsp; Mexican costume, with horse and hound, and all wanted copies of these&nbsp; effective photographs. Bess, also, was a favourite sitter; and Demi&nbsp; received a prize at the Amateur Photographic Exhibition for one of his&nbsp; cousin with all her hair about her face, which rose from the cloud of&nbsp; white lace draping the shoulders. These were freely handed round by the&nbsp; proud artist; and one copy had a tender little history yet to be told.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nat was snatching every minute he could get with Daisy before the long&nbsp; parting; and Mrs Meg relented somewhat, feeling sure that absence would&nbsp; quite cure this unfortunate fancy. Daisy said little; but her gentle&nbsp; face was sad when she was alone, and a few quiet tears dropped on the&nbsp; handkerchiefs she marked so daintily with her own hair. She was sure Nat&nbsp; would not forget her; and life looked rather forlorn without the&nbsp; dear fellow who had been her friend since the days of patty-pans and&nbsp; confidences in the willow-tree. She was an old-fashioned daughter,&nbsp; dutiful and docile, with such love and reverence for her mother that her&nbsp; will was law; and if love was forbidden, friendship must suffice. So she&nbsp; kept her little sorrow to herself, smiled cheerfully at Nat, and made&nbsp; his last days of home-life very happy with every comfort and pleasure&nbsp; she could give, from sensible advice and sweet words to a well-filled&nbsp; work-bag for his bachelor establishment and a box of goodies for the&nbsp; voyage.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom and Nan took all the time they could spare from their studies to&nbsp; enjoy high jinks at Plumfield with their old friends; for Emil<U+2019>s next&nbsp; voyage was to be a long one, Nat<U+2019>s absence was uncertain, and no one&nbsp; ever knew when Dan would turn up again. They all seemed to feel that&nbsp; life was beginning to grow serious; and even while they enjoyed those&nbsp; lovely summer days together they were conscious that they were children&nbsp; no longer, and often in the pauses of their fun talked soberly of their&nbsp; plans and hopes, as if anxious to know and help one another before they&nbsp; drifted farther apart on their different ways.&nbsp; &nbsp; A few weeks were all they had; then the Brenda was ready, Nat was to&nbsp; sail from New York, and Dan went along to see him off; for his own plans&nbsp; fermented in his head, and he was eager to be up and doing. A farewell&nbsp; dance was given on Parnassus in honour of the travellers, and all turned&nbsp; out in their best array and gayest spirits. George and Dolly came with&nbsp; the latest Harvard airs and graces, radiant to behold, in dress-suits&nbsp; and <U+2018>crushed hats<U+2019>, as Josie called the especial pride and joy of their&nbsp; boyish souls. Jack and Ned sent regrets and best wishes, and no one&nbsp; mourned their absence; for they were among what Mrs Jo called her&nbsp; failures. Poor Tom got into trouble, as usual, by deluging his head with&nbsp; some highly scented preparation in the vain hope of making his tight&nbsp; curls lie flat and smooth, as was the style. Unhappily, his rebellious&nbsp; crop only kinked the closer, and the odour of many barbers<U+2019> shops clung&nbsp; to him in spite of his frantic efforts to banish it. Nan wouldn<U+2019>t allow&nbsp; him near her, and flapped her fan vigorously whenever he was in sight;&nbsp; which cut him to the heart, and made him feel like the Peri shut out&nbsp; from Paradise. Of course his mates jeered at him, and nothing but the&nbsp; unquenchable jollity of his nature kept him from despair.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil was resplendent in his new uniform, and danced with an abandon&nbsp; which only sailors know. His pumps seemed to be everywhere, and his&nbsp; partners soon lost breath trying to keep up with him; but the girls&nbsp; all declared he steered like an angel, and in spite of his pace no&nbsp; collisions took place; so he was happy, and found no lack of damsels to&nbsp; ship with him.&nbsp; &nbsp; Having no dress-suit, Dan had been coaxed to wear his Mexican costume,&nbsp; and feeling at ease in the many-buttoned trousers, loose jacket, and gay&nbsp; sash, flung his serape over his shoulder with a flourish and looked&nbsp; his best, doing great execution with his long spurs, as he taught Josie&nbsp; strange steps or rolled his black eyes admiringly after certain blonde&nbsp; damsels whom he dared not address.&nbsp; &nbsp; The mammas sat in the alcove, supplying pins, smiles, and kindly words&nbsp; to all, especially the awkward youths new to such scenes, and the&nbsp; bashful girls conscious of faded muslins and cleaned gloves. It was&nbsp; pleasant to see stately Mrs Amy promenade on the arm of a tall country&nbsp; boy, with thick boots and a big forehead, or Mrs Jo dance like a girl&nbsp; with a shy fellow whose arms went like pump-handles, and whose face was&nbsp; scarlet with confusion and pride at the honour of treading on the toes&nbsp; of the president<U+2019>s wife. Mrs Meg always had room on her sofa for two&nbsp; or three girls, and Mr Laurie devoted himself to these plain, poorly&nbsp; dressed damsels with a kindly grace that won their hearts and made them&nbsp; happy. The good Professor circulated like refreshments, and his cheerful&nbsp; face shone on all alike, while Mr March discussed Greek comedy in the&nbsp; study with such serious gentlemen as never unbent their mighty minds to&nbsp; frivolous joys.&nbsp; &nbsp; The long music-room, parlour, hall, and piazza were full of white-gowned&nbsp; maidens with attendant shadows; the air was full of lively voices,&nbsp; and hearts and feet went lightly together as the home band played&nbsp; vigorously, and the friendly moon did her best to add enchantment to the&nbsp; scene.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Pin me up, Meg; that dear Dunbar boy has nearly rent me <U+201C>in sunder<U+201D>, as&nbsp; Mr Peggotty would say. But didn<U+2019>t he enjoy himself, bumping against his&nbsp; fellow men and swinging me round like a mop. On these occasions I find&nbsp; that I<U+2019>m not as young as I was, nor as light of foot. In ten years more&nbsp; we shall be meal-bags, sister; so be resigned.<U+2019> And Mrs Jo subsided into&nbsp; a corner, much dishevelled by her benevolent exertions.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know I shall be stout; but you won<U+2019>t keep still long enough to get&nbsp; much flesh on your bones, dear; and Amy will always keep her lovely&nbsp; figure. She looks about eighteen tonight, in her white gown and roses,<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Meg, busily pinning up one sister<U+2019>s torn frills, while her eyes&nbsp; fondly followed the other<U+2019>s graceful movements; for Meg still adored Amy&nbsp; in the old fashion.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was one of the family jokes that Jo was getting fat, and she kept it&nbsp; up, though as yet she had only acquired a matronly outline, which was&nbsp; very becoming. They were laughing over the impending double chins, when&nbsp; Mr Laurie came off duty for a moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Repairing damages as usual, Jo? You never could take a little gentle&nbsp; exercise without returning in rags. Come and have a quiet stroll with me&nbsp; and cool off before supper. I<U+2019>ve a series of pretty tableaux to show&nbsp; you while Meg listens to the raptures of lisping Miss Carr, whom I made&nbsp; happy by giving her Demi for a partner.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As he spoke, Laurie led Jo to the music-room, nearly empty now after a&nbsp; dance which sent the young people into garden and hall. Pausing before&nbsp; the first of the four long windows that opened on a very wide piazza, he&nbsp; pointed to a group outside, saying: <U+2018>The name of this is <U+201C>Jack Ashore<U+201D>.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; A pair of long, blue legs, ending in very neat pumps, hung from the&nbsp; veranda roof among the vines; and roses, gathered by unseen hands,&nbsp; evidently appertaining to aforesaid legs, were being dropped into the&nbsp; laps of several girls perched like a flock of white birds on the railing&nbsp; below; while a manly voice <U+2018>fell like a falling star<U+2019>, as it sung this&nbsp; pensive ditty to a most appreciative audience:&nbsp; &nbsp;              MARY<U+2019>S DREAM&nbsp; &nbsp;     The moon had climbed the eastern hill&nbsp;     Which rises o<U+2019>er the sands of Dee,&nbsp;     And from its highest summit shed&nbsp;     A silver light on tower and tree,&nbsp;     When Mary laid her down to sleep&nbsp;     (Her thoughts on Sandy far at sea);&nbsp;     When soft and low a voice was heard,&nbsp;     Saying, <U+2018>Mary, weep no more for me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp;     She from her pillow gently raised&nbsp;     Her head, to see who there might be,&nbsp;     And saw young Sandy, shivering stand&nbsp;     With visage pale and hollow e<U+2019>e.&nbsp;     <U+2018>Oh Mary dear, cold is my clay;&nbsp;     It lies beneath the stormy sea;&nbsp;     Far, far from thee, I sleep in death.&nbsp;     Dear Mary, weep no more for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Three stormy nights and stormy days&nbsp;     We tossed upon the raging main.&nbsp;     And long we strove our bark to save;&nbsp;     But all our striving was in vain.&nbsp;     E<U+2019>en then, when terror chilled my blood,&nbsp;     My heart was filled with love of thee.&nbsp;     The storm is past, and I<U+2019>m at rest;&nbsp;     So, Mary, weep no more for me.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Oh maiden dear, yourself prepare;&nbsp;     We soon shall meet upon that shore&nbsp;     Where love is free from doubt and care,&nbsp;     And you and I shall part no more.<U+2019>&nbsp;     Loud crew the cock, the shadow fled;&nbsp;     No more her Sandy did she see;&nbsp;     But soft the passing spirit said,&nbsp;     <U+2018>Sweet Mary, weep no more for me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The constant jollity of that boy is worth a fortune to him. He<U+2019>ll never&nbsp; sink with such a buoyant spirit to keep him afloat through life,<U+2019> said&nbsp; Mrs Jo, as the roses were tossed back with much applause when the song&nbsp; ended.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not he; and it<U+2019>s a blessing to be grateful for, isn<U+2019>t it? We moody&nbsp; people know its worth. Glad you like my first tableau. Come and see&nbsp; number two. Hope it isn<U+2019>t spoilt; it was very pretty just now. This is&nbsp; <U+201C>Othello telling his adventures to Desdemona<U+201D>.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The second window framed a very picturesque group of three. Mr March in&nbsp; an arm-chair, with Bess on a cushion at his feet, was listening to Dan,&nbsp; who, leaning against a pillar, was talking with unusual animation. The&nbsp; old man was in shadow, but little Desdemona was looking up with the&nbsp; moonlight full upon her into young Othello<U+2019>s face, quite absorbed in the&nbsp; story he was telling so well. The gay drapery over Dan<U+2019>s shoulder,&nbsp; his dark colouring, and the gesture of his arm made the picture very&nbsp; striking, and both spectators enjoyed it with silent pleasure, till Mrs&nbsp; Jo said in a quick whisper:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad he<U+2019>s going away. He<U+2019>s too picturesque to have here among so&nbsp; many romantic girls. Afraid his <U+201C>grand, gloomy, and peculiar<U+201D> style will&nbsp; be too much for our simple maids.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No danger; Dan is in the rough as yet, and always will be, I fancy;&nbsp; though he is improving in many ways. How well Queenie looks in that soft&nbsp; light!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dear little Goldilocks looks well everywhere.<U+2019> And with a backward&nbsp; glance full of pride and fondness, Mrs Jo went on. But that scene&nbsp; returned to her long afterward and her own prophetic words also.&nbsp; &nbsp; Number three was a tragical tableau at first sight; and Mr Laurie&nbsp; stifled a laugh as he whispered <U+2018>The Wounded Knight<U+2019>, pointing to Tom&nbsp; with his head enveloped in a large handkerchief, as he knelt before Nan,&nbsp; who was extracting a thorn or splinter from the palm of his hand&nbsp; with great skill, to judge from the patient<U+2019>s blissful expression of&nbsp; countenance.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do I hurt you?<U+2019> she asked, turning the hand to the moonlight for a&nbsp; better view.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not a bit; dig away; I like it,<U+2019> answered Tom, regardless of his aching&nbsp; knees and the damage done to his best trousers.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I won<U+2019>t keep you long.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hours, if you please. Never so happy as here.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite unmoved by this tender remark, Nan put on a pair of large,&nbsp; round-eyed glasses, saying in a matter-of-fact tone: <U+2018>Now I see it. Only&nbsp; a splinter, and there it is.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My hand is bleeding; won<U+2019>t you bind it up?<U+2019> asked Tom, wishing to&nbsp; prolong the situation.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Nonsense; suck it. Only take care of it tomorrow if you dissect. Don<U+2019>t&nbsp; want any more blood-poisoning.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That was the only time you were kind to me. Wish I<U+2019>d lost my arm.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I wish you<U+2019>d lost your head; it smells more like turpentine and&nbsp; kerosene than ever. Do take a run in the garden and air it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fearing to betray themselves by laughter, the watchers went on, leaving&nbsp; the Knight to rush away in despair, and the Lady to bury her nose in the&nbsp; cup of a tall lily for refreshment.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Poor Tom, his fate is a hard one, and he<U+2019>s wasting his time! Do advise&nbsp; him to quit philandering and go to work, Jo.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have, Teddy, often; but it will take some great shock to make that&nbsp; boy wise. I wait with interest to see what it will be. Bless me! what is&nbsp; all this?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; She might well ask; for on a rustic stool stood Ted trying to pose on&nbsp; one foot, with the other extended, and both hands waving in the air.&nbsp; Josie, with several young mates, was watching his contortions with deep&nbsp; interest as they talked about <U+2018>little wings<U+2019>, <U+2018>gilded wire twisted<U+2019>, and&nbsp; a <U+2018>cunning skull-cap<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This might be called <U+201C>Mercury Trying to Fly<U+201D>,<U+2019> said Mr Laurie, as they&nbsp; peeped through the lace curtains.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless the long legs of that boy! how does he expect to manage them?&nbsp; They are planning for the Owlsdark Marbles, and a nice muddle they will&nbsp; make of my gods and goddesses with no one to show them how,<U+2019> answered&nbsp; Mrs Jo, enjoying this scene immensely. <U+2018>Now, he<U+2019>s got it!<U+2019> <U+2018>That<U+2019>s&nbsp; perfectly splendid!<U+2019> <U+2018>See how long you can keep so!<U+2019> cried the girls, as&nbsp; Ted managed to maintain his equilibrium a moment by resting one toe&nbsp; on the trellis. Unfortunately this brought all his weight on the other&nbsp; foot; the straw seat of the stool gave way, and the flying Mercury&nbsp; came down with a crash, amid shrieks of laughter from the girls. Being&nbsp; accustomed to ground and lofty tumbling, he quickly recovered himself,&nbsp; and hopped gaily about, with one leg through the stool as he improvised&nbsp; a classic jig.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thanks for four nice little pictures. You have given me an idea, and I&nbsp; think some time we will get up regular tableaux of this sort and march&nbsp; our company round a set of dissolving views. New and striking; I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; propose it to our manager and give you all the glory,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, as&nbsp; they strolled towards the room whence came the clash of glass and china,&nbsp; and glimpses of agitated black coats.&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us follow the example of our old friends and stroll about among the&nbsp; young people, eavesdropping, so gathering up various little threads to&nbsp; help in the weaving of the story. George and Dolly were at supper,&nbsp; and having served the ladies in their care stood in a corner absorbing&nbsp; nourishment of all kinds with a vain attempt to conceal hearty appetites&nbsp; under an air of elegant indifference.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Good spread, this; Laurence does things in style. First-rate coffee,&nbsp; but no wine, and that<U+2019>s a mistake,<U+2019> said Stuffy, who still deserved his&nbsp; name, and was a stout youth with a heavy eye and bilious complexion.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bad for boys, he says. Jove! wish he could see us at some of our wines.&nbsp; Don<U+2019>t we just <U+201C>splice the main brace<U+201D> as Emil says,<U+2019> answered Dolly,&nbsp; the dandy, carefully spreading a napkin over the glossy expanse of&nbsp; shirt-front whereon a diamond stud shone like a lone star. His stutter&nbsp; was nearly outgrown; but he, as well as George, spoke in the tone of&nbsp; condescension, which, with the blase airs they assumed, made a very&nbsp; funny contrast to their youthful faces and foolish remarks. Good-hearted&nbsp; little fellows both, but top-heavy with the pride of being Sophs and the&nbsp; freedom that college life gave them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Little Jo is getting to be a deuced pretty girl, isn<U+2019>t she?<U+2019> said&nbsp; George, with a long sigh of satisfaction as his first mouthful of ice&nbsp; went slowly down his throat.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>H<U+2019>m--well, fairish. The Princess is rather more to my taste. I like <U+2018>em&nbsp; blonde and queenly and elegant, don<U+2019>t you know.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, Jo is too lively; might as well dance with a grasshopper.&nbsp; I<U+2019>ve tried her, and she<U+2019>s one too many for me. Miss Perry is a nice,&nbsp; easy-going girl. Got her for the german.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You<U+2019>ll never be a dancing man. Too lazy. Now I<U+2019>ll undertake to steer&nbsp; any girl and dance down any fellow you please. Dancing<U+2019>s my forte.<U+2019> And&nbsp; Dolly glanced from his trim feet to his flashing gem with the defiant&nbsp; air of a young turkey-cock on parade.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Miss Grey is looking for you. Wants more grub. Just see if Miss&nbsp; Nelson<U+2019>s plate is empty, there<U+2019>s a good fellow. Can<U+2019>t eat ice in a&nbsp; hurry.<U+2019> And George remained in his safe corner, while Dolly struggled&nbsp; through the crowd to do his duty, coming back in a fume, with a splash&nbsp; of salad dressing on his coat-cuff.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Confound these country chaps! they go blundering round like so many&nbsp; dor-bugs, and make a deuce of a mess. Better stick to books and not try&nbsp; to be society men. Can<U+2019>t do it. Beastly stain. Give it a rub, and let me&nbsp; bolt a mouthful, I<U+2019>m starved. Never saw girls eat such a lot. It proves&nbsp; that they ought not to study so much. Never liked co-ed,<U+2019> growled Dolly,&nbsp; much ruffled in spirit.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So they do. <U+2018>Tisn<U+2019>t ladylike. Ought to be satisfied with an ice and&nbsp; a bit of cake, and eat it prettily. Don<U+2019>t like to see a girl feed. We&nbsp; hard-working men need it, and, by Jove, I mean to get some more of that&nbsp; meringue if it<U+2019>s not all gone. Here, waiter! bring along that dish over&nbsp; there, and be lively,<U+2019> commanded Stuffy, poking a young man in a rather&nbsp; shabby dress-suit, who was passing with a tray of glasses.&nbsp; &nbsp; His order was obeyed promptly; but George<U+2019>s appetite was taken away&nbsp; the next moment by Dolly<U+2019>s exclaiming, as he looked up from his damaged&nbsp; coat, with a scandalized face:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You<U+2019>ve put your foot in it now, old boy! that<U+2019>s Morton, Mr Bhaer<U+2019>s&nbsp; crack man. Knows everything, no end of a <U+201C>dig<U+201D>, and bound to carry off&nbsp; all the honours. You won<U+2019>t hear the last of it in a hurry.<U+2019> And Dolly&nbsp; laughed so heartily that a spoonful of ice flew upon the head of a lady&nbsp; sitting below him, and got him into a scrape also.&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving them to their despair, let us listen to the whispered chat of&nbsp; two girls comfortably seated in a recess waiting till their escorts were&nbsp; fed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I do think the Laurences give lovely parties. Don<U+2019>t you enjoy them?<U+2019>&nbsp; asked the younger, looking about her with the eager air of one unused to&nbsp; this sort of pleasure.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very much, only I never feel as if I was dressed right. My things&nbsp; seemed elegant at home, and I thought I<U+2019>d be over over-dressed if&nbsp; anything; but I look countrified and dowdy here. No time or money to&nbsp; change now, even if I knew how to do it,<U+2019> answered the other, glancing&nbsp; anxiously at her bright pink silk grown, trimmed with cheap lace.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You must get Mrs Brooke to tell you how to fix your things. She was&nbsp; very kind to me. I had a green silk, and it looked so cheap and horrid&nbsp; by the side of the nice dresses here I felt regularly unhappy about it,&nbsp; and asked her how much a dress like one Mrs Laurence had would cost.&nbsp; That looked so simple and elegant I thought it wouldn<U+2019>t be costly; but&nbsp; it was India mull and Valenciennes lace, so, of course, I couldn<U+2019>t have&nbsp; it. Then Mrs Brooke said: <U+201C>Get some muslin to cover the green silk, and&nbsp; wear hops or some white flowers, instead of pink, in your hair, and you&nbsp; will have a pretty suit.<U+201D> Isn<U+2019>t it lovely and becoming?<U+2019> And Miss Burton&nbsp; surveyed herself with girlish satisfaction; for a little taste had&nbsp; softened the harsh green, and hop-bells became her red hair better than&nbsp; roses.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s sweet: I<U+2019>ve been admiring it. I<U+2019>ll do mine so and ask about my&nbsp; purple one. Mrs Brooke has helped me to get rid of my headaches, and&nbsp; Mary Clay<U+2019>s dyspepsia is all gone since she gave up coffee and hot&nbsp; bread.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mrs Laurence advised me to walk and run and use the gymnasium to cure&nbsp; my round shoulders and open my chest, and I<U+2019>m a much better figure than&nbsp; I was.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Did you know that Mr Laurence pays all Amelia Merrill<U+2019>s bills? Her&nbsp; father failed, and she was heartbroken at having to leave college; but&nbsp; that splendid man just stepped in and made it all right.<U+2019> <U+2018>Yes, and&nbsp; Professor Bhaer has several of the boys down at his house evenings to&nbsp; help them along so they can keep up with the rest; and Mrs Bhaer took&nbsp; care of Charles Mackey herself when he had a fever last year. I do think&nbsp; they are the best and kindest people in the world.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So do I, and my time here will be the happiest and most useful years of&nbsp; my life.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; And both girls forgot their gowns and their suppers for a moment to look&nbsp; with grateful, affectionate eyes at the friends who tried to care for&nbsp; bodies and for souls as well as minds.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now come to a lively party supping on the stairs, girls like foam at&nbsp; the top, and a substratum of youths below, where the heaviest particles&nbsp; always settle. Emil, who never sat if he could climb or perch, adorned&nbsp; the newel-post; Tom, Nat, Demi, and Dan were camped on the steps, eating&nbsp; busily, as their ladies were well served and they had earned a moment<U+2019>s&nbsp; rest, which they enjoyed with their eyes fixed on the pleasing prospect&nbsp; above them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m so sorry the boys are going. It will be dreadfully dull without&nbsp; them. Now they have stopped teasing and are polite, I really enjoy&nbsp; them,<U+2019> said Nan, who felt unusually gracious tonight as Tom<U+2019>s mishap&nbsp; kept him from annoying her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So do I; and Bess was mourning about it today, though as a general&nbsp; thing she doesn<U+2019>t like boys unless they are models of elegance. She has&nbsp; been doing Dan<U+2019>s head, and it is not quite finished. I never saw her so&nbsp; interested in any work, and it<U+2019>s very well done. He is so striking and&nbsp; big he always makes me think of the Dying Gladiator or some of those&nbsp; antique creatures. There<U+2019>s Bess now. Dear child, how sweet she looks&nbsp; tonight!<U+2019> answered Daisy, waving her hand as the Princess went by with&nbsp; Grandpa on her arm.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I never thought he would turn out so well. Don<U+2019>t you remember how we&nbsp; used to call him <U+201C>the bad boy<U+201D> and be sure he would become a pirate or&nbsp; something awful because he glared at us and swore sometimes? Now he is&nbsp; the handsomest of all the boys, and very entertaining with his stories&nbsp; and plans. I like him very much; he<U+2019>s so big and strong and independent.&nbsp; I<U+2019>m tired of mollycoddles and book-worms,<U+2019> said Nan in her decided way.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not handsomer that Nat!<U+2019> cried loyal Daisy, contrasting two faces&nbsp; below, one unusually gay, the other sentimentally sober even in the&nbsp; act of munching cake. <U+2018>I like Dan, and am glad he is doing well; but&nbsp; he tires me, and I<U+2019>m still a little afraid of him. Quiet people suit me&nbsp; best.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Life is a fight, and I like a good soldier. Boys take things too&nbsp; easily, don<U+2019>t see how serious it all is and go to work in earnest. Look&nbsp; at that absurd Tom, wasting his time and making an object of himself&nbsp; just because he can<U+2019>t have what he wants, like a baby crying for the&nbsp; moon. I<U+2019>ve no patience with such nonsense,<U+2019> scolded Nan, looking down at&nbsp; the jovial Thomas, who was playfully putting macaroons in Emil<U+2019>s shoes,&nbsp; and trying to beguile his exile as best he could.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Most girls would be touched by such fidelity. I think it<U+2019>s beautiful,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Daisy behind her fan; for other girls sat just below.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are a sentimental goose and not a judge. Nat will be twice the man&nbsp; when he comes back after his trip. I wish Tom was going with him. My&nbsp; idea is that if we girls have any influence we should use it for the&nbsp; good of these boys, and not pamper them up, making slaves of ourselves&nbsp; and tyrants of them. Let them prove what they can do and be before they&nbsp; ask anything of us, and give us a chance to do the same. Then we know&nbsp; where we are, and shall not make mistakes to mourn over all our lives.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hear, hear!<U+2019> cried Alice Heath, who was a girl after Nan<U+2019>s own heart,&nbsp; and had chosen a career, like a brave and sensible young woman. <U+2018>Only&nbsp; give us a chance, and have patience till we can do our best. Now we are&nbsp; expected to be as wise as men who have had generations of all the help&nbsp; there is, and we scarcely anything. Let us have equal opportunities, and&nbsp; in a few generations we will see what the judgement is. I like justice,&nbsp; and we get very little of it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Still shouting the battle-cry of freedom?<U+2019> asked Demi, peering through&nbsp; the banisters at this moment. <U+2018>Up with your flag! I<U+2019>ll stand by and lend&nbsp; a hand if you want it. With you and Nan to lead the van, I think you&nbsp; won<U+2019>t need much help.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are a great comfort, Demi, and I<U+2019>ll call on you in all emergencies;&nbsp; for you are an honest boy, and don<U+2019>t forget that you owe much to your&nbsp; mother and your sisters and your aunts,<U+2019> continued Nan. <U+2018>I do like men&nbsp; who come out frankly and own that they are not gods. How can we think&nbsp; them so when such awful mistakes are being made all the time by these&nbsp; great creatures? See them sick, as I do, then you know them.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t hit us when we are down; be merciful, and set us up to bless and&nbsp; believe in you evermore,<U+2019> pleaded Demi from behind the bars.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We<U+2019>ll be kind to you if you will be just to us. I don<U+2019>t say generous,&nbsp; only just. I went to a suffrage debate in the Legislature last winter;&nbsp; and of all the feeble, vulgar twaddle I ever heard, that was the worst;&nbsp; and those men were our representatives. I blushed for them, and the&nbsp; wives and mothers. I want an intelligent man to represent me, if I can<U+2019>t&nbsp; do it myself, not a fool.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Nan is on the stump. Now we shall catch it,<U+2019> cried Tom, putting up&nbsp; an umbrella to shield his unhappy head; for Nan<U+2019>s earnest voice was&nbsp; audible, and her indignant eye happened to rest on him as she spoke.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Go on, go on! I<U+2019>ll take notes, and put in <U+201C>great applause<U+201D> liberally,<U+2019>&nbsp; added Demi, producing his ball-book and pencil, with his Jenkins air.&nbsp; &nbsp; Daisy pinched his nose through the bars, and the meeting was rather&nbsp; tumultuous for a moment, for Emil called: <U+2018>Avast, avast, here<U+2019>s a squall&nbsp; to wind<U+2019>ard<U+2019>; Tom applauded wildly; Dan looked up as if the prospect of&nbsp; a fight, even with words, pleased him, and Nat went to support Demi,&nbsp; as his position seemed to be a good one. At this crisis, when everyone&nbsp; laughed and talked at once, Bess came floating through the upper hall&nbsp; and looked down like an angel of peace upon the noisy group below, as&nbsp; she asked, with wondering eyes and smiling lips:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What is it?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>An indignation meeting. Nan and Alice are on the rampage, and we are at&nbsp; the bar to be tried for our lives. Will Your Highness preside and judge&nbsp; between us?<U+2019> answered Demi, as a lull at once took place; for no one&nbsp; rioted in the presence of the Princess.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m not wise enough. I<U+2019>ll sit here and listen. Please go on.<U+2019> And Bess&nbsp; took her place above them all as cool and calm as a little statue of&nbsp; Justice, with fan and nosegay in place of sword and scales.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now, ladies, free your minds, only spare us till morning; for we<U+2019>ve&nbsp; got a german to dance as soon as everyone is fed, and Parnassus expects&nbsp; every man to do his duty. Mrs President Giddy-gaddy has the floor,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Demi, who liked this sort of fun better than the very mild sort of&nbsp; flirtation which was allowed at Plumfield, for the simple reason that it&nbsp; could not be entirely banished, and is a part of all education, co- or&nbsp; otherwise.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have only one thing to say, and it is this,<U+2019> began Nan soberly,&nbsp; though her eyes sparkled with a mixture of fun and earnestness. <U+2018>I want&nbsp; to ask every boy of you what you really think on this subject. Dan and&nbsp; Emil have seen the world and ought to know their own minds. Tom and Nat&nbsp; have had five examples before them for years. Demi is ours and we are&nbsp; proud of him. So is Rob. Ted is a weathercock, and Dolly and George,&nbsp; of course, are fogies in spite of the Annex, and girls at Girton going&nbsp; ahead of the men. Commodore, are you ready for the question?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ay, ay, skipper.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do you believe in Woman<U+2019>s Suffrage?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless your pretty figger head! I do, and I<U+2019>ll ship a crew of girls any&nbsp; time you say so. Aren<U+2019>t they worse than a press-gang to carry a fellow&nbsp; out of his moorings? Don<U+2019>t we all need one as pilot to steer us safe to&nbsp; port? and why shouldn<U+2019>t they share our mess afloat and ashore since we&nbsp; are sure to be wrecked without <U+2018>em?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Good for you, Emil! Nan will take you for first mate after that&nbsp; handsome speech,<U+2019> said Demi, as the girls applauded, and Tom glowered.&nbsp; <U+2018>Now, Dan, you love liberty so well yourself, are you willing we should&nbsp; have it?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>All you can get, and I<U+2019>ll fight any man who<U+2019>s mean enough to say you&nbsp; don<U+2019>t deserve it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; This brief and forcible reply delighted the energetic President, and she&nbsp; beamed upon the member from California, as she said briskly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Nat wouldn<U+2019>t dare to say he was on the other side even if he were, but&nbsp; I hope he has made up his mind to pipe for us, at least when we take the&nbsp; field, and not be one of those who wait till the battle is won, and then&nbsp; beat the drums and share the glory.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Giddy-gaddy<U+2019>s doubts were most effectually removed, and her sharp&nbsp; speech regretted, as Nat looked up blushing, but with a new sort of&nbsp; manliness in face and manner, saying, in a tone that touched them all:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I should be the most ungrateful fellow alive if I did not love,&nbsp; honour, and serve women with all my heart and might, for to them I owe&nbsp; everything I am or ever shall be.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Daisy clapped her hands, and Bess threw her bouquet into Nat<U+2019>s lap,&nbsp; while the other girls waved their fans, well pleased; for real feeling&nbsp; made his little speech eloquent.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thomas B. Bangs, come into court, and tell the truth, the whole truth,&nbsp; and nothing but the truth, if you can,<U+2019> commanded Nan, with a rap to&nbsp; call the meeting to order.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom shut the umbrella, and standing up raised his hand, saying solemnly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I believe in suffrage of all kinds. I adore all women, and will die for&nbsp; them at any moment if it will help the cause.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Living and working for it is harder, and therefore more honourable. Men&nbsp; are always ready to die for us, but not to make our lives worth having.&nbsp; Cheap sentiment and bad logic. You will pass, Tom, only don<U+2019>t twaddle.&nbsp; Now, having taken the sense of the meeting we will adjourn, as the hour&nbsp; for festive gymnastics has arrived. I am glad to see that old Plum&nbsp; has given six true men to the world, and hope they will continue to be&nbsp; staunch to her and the principles she has taught them, wherever they may&nbsp; go. Now, girls, don<U+2019>t sit in draughts, and, boys, beware of ice-water&nbsp; when you are warm.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; With this characteristic close Nan retired from office, and the girls&nbsp; went to enjoy one of the few rights allowed them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 6. LAST WORDS&nbsp; &nbsp; The next day was Sunday, and a goodly troop of young and old set forth&nbsp; to church.--some driving, some walking, all enjoying the lovely weather&nbsp; and the happy quietude which comes to refresh us when the work and worry&nbsp; of the week are over. Daisy had a headache; and Aunt Jo remained at home&nbsp; to keep her company, knowing very well that the worst ache was in the&nbsp; tender heart struggling dutifully against the love that grew stronger as&nbsp; the parting drew nearer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Daisy knows my wishes, and I trust her. You must keep an eye on Nat,&nbsp; and let him clearly understand that there is to be no <U+201C>lovering<U+201D>, or&nbsp; I shall forbid the letter-writing. I hate to seem cruel, but it is too&nbsp; soon for my dear girl to bind herself in any way,<U+2019> said Mrs Meg, as she&nbsp; rustled about in her best grey silk, while waiting for Demi, who always&nbsp; escorted his pious mother to church as a peace-offering for crossing her&nbsp; wishes in other things.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will, dear; I<U+2019>m lying in wait for all three boys today, like an old&nbsp; spider; and I will have a good talk with each. They know I understand&nbsp; them, and they always open their hearts sooner or later. You look like a&nbsp; nice, plump little Quakeress, Meg; and no one will believe that big&nbsp; boy is your son,<U+2019> added Mrs Jo, as Demi came in shining with Sunday&nbsp; neatness, from his well-blacked boots to his smooth brown head.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You flatter me, to soften my heart toward your boy. I know your ways,&nbsp; Jo, and I don<U+2019>t give in. Be firm, and spare me a scene by and by. As for&nbsp; John, as long as he is satisfied with his old mother, I don<U+2019>t care what&nbsp; people think,<U+2019> answered Mrs Meg, accepting with a smile the little posy&nbsp; of sweet peas and mignonette Demi brought her.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, having buttoned her dove-coloured gloves with care, she took her&nbsp; son<U+2019>s arm and went proudly away to the carriage, where Amy and Bess&nbsp; waited, while Jo called after them, just as Marmee used to do:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Girls, have you got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?<U+2019> They all smiled at&nbsp; the familiar words, and three white banners waved as they drove away,&nbsp; leaving the spider to watch for her first fly. She did not wait long.&nbsp; Daisy was lying down with a wet cheek on the little hymnbook out of&nbsp; which she and Nat used to sing together; so Mrs Jo strolled about&nbsp; the lawn, looking very like a wandering mushroom with her large buff&nbsp; umbrella.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan had gone for a ten-mile stroll; and Nat was supposed to have&nbsp; accompanied him, but presently came sneaking back, unable to tear&nbsp; himself away from the Dovecote or lose a moment of nearness to his idol&nbsp; that last day. Mrs Jo saw him at once, and beckoned him to a rustic seat&nbsp; under the old elm, where they could have their confidences undisturbed,&nbsp; and both keep an eye on a certain white-curtained window, half hidden in&nbsp; vines.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Nice and cool here. I<U+2019>m not up to one of Dan<U+2019>s tramps today--it<U+2019>s so&nbsp; warm, and he goes so like a steam-engine. He headed for the swamp where&nbsp; his pet snakes used to live, and I begged to be excused,<U+2019> said Nat,&nbsp; fanning himself with his straw hat, though the day was not oppressive.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad you did. Sit and rest with me, and have one of our good old&nbsp; talks. We<U+2019>ve both been so busy lately, I feel as if I didn<U+2019>t half know&nbsp; your plans; and I want to,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, feeling sure that though&nbsp; they might start with Leipzig they would bring up at Plumfield.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are very kind, and there<U+2019>s nothing I<U+2019>d like better. I don<U+2019>t realize&nbsp; I<U+2019>m going so far--suppose I shan<U+2019>t till I get afloat. It<U+2019>s a splendid&nbsp; start, and I don<U+2019>t know how I can ever thank Mr Laurie for all he<U+2019>s&nbsp; done, or you either,<U+2019> added Nat, with a break in his voice; for he was a&nbsp; tender-hearted fellow, and never forgot a kindness.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You can thank us beautifully by being and doing all we hope and expect&nbsp; of you, my dear. In the new life you are going to there will be a&nbsp; thousand trials and temptations, and only your own wit and wisdom to&nbsp; rely on. That will be the time to test the principles we have tried&nbsp; to give you, and see how firm they are. Of course, you will make&nbsp; mistakes--we all do; but don<U+2019>t let go of your conscience and drift along&nbsp; blindly. Watch and pray, dear Nat; and while your hand gains skill, let&nbsp; your head grow wiser, and keep your heart as innocent and warm as it is&nbsp; now.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll try, Mother Bhaer, my very best to be a credit to you. I know I&nbsp; shall improve in my music--can<U+2019>t help it there; but I never shall be&nbsp; very wise, I<U+2019>m afraid. As for my heart, you know, I leave it behind me&nbsp; in good keeping.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As he spoke, Nat<U+2019>s eyes were fixed on the window with a look of love and&nbsp; longing that made his quiet face both manly and sad--plainly showing how&nbsp; strong a hold this boyish affection had upon him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I want to speak of that; and I know you will forgive what seems hard,&nbsp; because I do most heartily sympathize with you,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, glad to&nbsp; have her say.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, do talk about Daisy! I think of nothing but leaving and losing&nbsp; her. I have no hope--I suppose it is too much to ask; only I can<U+2019>t help&nbsp; loving her, wherever I am!<U+2019> cried Nat, with a mixture of defiance and&nbsp; despair in his face that rather startled Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Listen to me and I<U+2019>ll try to give you both comfort and good advice. We&nbsp; all know that Daisy is fond of you, but her mother objects, and being a&nbsp; good girl she tries to obey. Young people think they never can change,&nbsp; but they do in the most wonderful manner, and very few die of broken&nbsp; hearts.<U+2019> Mrs Jo smiled as she remembered another boy whom she had once&nbsp; tried to comfort, and then went soberly on while Nat listened as if his&nbsp; fate hung upon her lips.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>One of two things will happen. You will find someone else to love,&nbsp; or, better still, be so busy and happy in your music that you will be&nbsp; willing to wait for time to settle the matter for you both. Daisy will&nbsp; perhaps forget when you are gone, and be glad you are only friends. At&nbsp; any rate it is much wiser to have no promises made; then both are free,&nbsp; and in a year or two may meet to laugh over the little romance nipped in&nbsp; the bud.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do you honestly think that?<U+2019> asked Nat, looking at her so keenly that&nbsp; the truth had to come; for all his heart was in those frank blue eyes of&nbsp; his.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, I don<U+2019>t!<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo. <U+2018>Then if you were in my place, what&nbsp; would you do?<U+2019> he added, with a tone of command never heard in his&nbsp; gentle voice before.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless me! the boy is in dead earnest, and I shall forget prudence&nbsp; in sympathy I<U+2019>m afraid,<U+2019> thought Mrs Jo, surprised and pleased by the&nbsp; unexpected manliness Nat showed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll tell you what I should do. I<U+2019>d say to myself:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+201C>I<U+2019>ll prove that my love is strong and faithful, and make Daisy<U+2019>s&nbsp; mother proud to give her to me by being not only a good musician but an&nbsp; excellent man, and so command respect and confidence. This I will try&nbsp; for; and if I fail, I shall be the better for the effort, and find&nbsp; comfort in the thought that I did my best for her sake.<U+201D><U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That is what I meant to do. But I wanted a word of hope to give me&nbsp; courage,<U+2019> cried Nat, firing up as if the smouldering spark was set&nbsp; ablaze by a breath of encouragement. <U+2018>Other fellows, poorer and stupider&nbsp; than I, have done great things and come to honour. Why may not I, though&nbsp; I<U+2019>m nothing now? I know Mrs Brooke remembers what I came from, but my&nbsp; father was honest though everything went wrong; and I have nothing to&nbsp; be ashamed of though I was a charity boy. I never will be ashamed of my&nbsp; people or myself, and I<U+2019>ll make other folks respect me if I can.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Good! that<U+2019>s the right spirit, Nat. Hold to it and make yourself a man.&nbsp; No one will be quicker to see and admire the brave work than my sister&nbsp; Meg. She does not despise your poverty or your past; but mothers are&nbsp; very tender over their daughters, and we Marches, though we have been&nbsp; poor, are, I confess, a little proud of our good family. We don<U+2019>t care&nbsp; for money; but a long line of virtuous ancestors is something to desire&nbsp; and to be proud of.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, the Blakes are a good lot. I looked <U+2018>em up, and not one was&nbsp; ever in prison, hanged, or disgraced in any way. We used to be rich and&nbsp; honoured years ago, but we<U+2019>ve died out and got poor, and father was a&nbsp; street musician rather than beg; and I<U+2019>ll be one again before I<U+2019>ll do&nbsp; the mean things some men do and pass muster.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nat was so excited that Mrs Jo indulged in a laugh to calm him, and both&nbsp; went on more quietly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I told my sister all that and it pleased her. I am sure if you do well&nbsp; these next few years that she will relent and all be happily settled,&nbsp; unless that wonderful change, which you don<U+2019>t believe possible, should&nbsp; occur. Now, cheer up; don<U+2019>t be lackadaisical and blue. Say good-bye&nbsp; cheerfully and bravely, show a manly front, and leave a pleasant memory&nbsp; behind you. We all wish you well and hope much for you. Write to me&nbsp; every week and I<U+2019>ll send a good, gossipy answer. Be careful what you&nbsp; write to Daisy; don<U+2019>t gush or wail, for sister Meg will see the letters;&nbsp; and you can help your cause very much by sending sensible, cheery&nbsp; accounts of your life to us all.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will; I will; it looks brighter and better already, and I won<U+2019>t lose&nbsp; my one comfort by any fault of my own. Thank you so much, Mother Bhaer,&nbsp; for taking my side. I felt so ungrateful and mean and crushed when I&nbsp; thought you all considered me a sneak who had no business to love such&nbsp; a precious girl as Daisy. No one said anything, but I knew how you felt,&nbsp; and that Mr Laurie sent me off partly to get me out of the way. Oh dear,&nbsp; life is pretty tough sometimes, isn<U+2019>t it?<U+2019> And Nat took his head in both&nbsp; hands as if it ached with the confusion of hopes and fears, passions and&nbsp; plans that proved boyhood was past and manhood had begun.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very tough, but it is that very struggle with obstacles which does us&nbsp; good. Things have been made easy for you in many ways, but no one can do&nbsp; everything. You must paddle your own canoe now, and learn to avoid the&nbsp; rapids and steer straight to the port you want to reach. I don<U+2019>t know&nbsp; just what your temptations will be for you have no bad habits and seem&nbsp; to love music so well, nothing can lure you from it. I only hope you&nbsp; won<U+2019>t work too hard.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I feel as if I could work like a horse, I<U+2019>m so eager to get on; but&nbsp; I<U+2019>ll take care. Can<U+2019>t waste time being sick, and you<U+2019>ve given me doses&nbsp; enough to keep me all right, I guess.<U+2019> Nat laughed as he remembered&nbsp; the book of directions Mrs Jo had written for him to consult on all&nbsp; occasions.&nbsp; &nbsp; She immediately added some verbal ones on the subject of foreign messes,&nbsp; and having mounted one of her pet hobbies, was in full gallop when Emil&nbsp; was seen strolling about on the roof of the old house, that being his&nbsp; favourite promenade; for there he could fancy himself walking the deck,&nbsp; with only blue sky and fresh air about him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I want a word with the Commodore, and up there we shall be nice and&nbsp; quiet. Go and play to Daisy: it will put her to sleep and do you both&nbsp; good. Sit in the porch, so I can keep an eye on you as I promised<U+2019>; and&nbsp; with a motherly pat on the shoulder Mrs Jo left Nat to his delightful&nbsp; task and briskly ascended to the house-top, not up the trellis as of old&nbsp; but by means of the stairs inside.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emerging on the platform she found Emil cutting his initials afresh in&nbsp; the wood-work and singing <U+2018>Pull for the Shore<U+2019>, like the tuneful mariner&nbsp; he was.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come aboard and make yourself at home, Aunty,<U+2019> he said, with a playful&nbsp; salute. <U+2018>I<U+2019>m just leaving a P.P.C. in the old place, so when you fly up&nbsp; here for refuge you<U+2019>ll remember me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ah, my dear, I<U+2019>m not likely to forget you. It doesn<U+2019>t need E. B. H. cut&nbsp; on all the trees and railings to remind me of my sailor boy<U+2019>; and Mrs Jo&nbsp; took the seat nearest the blue figure astride the balustrade, not quite&nbsp; sure how to begin the little sermon she wanted to preach.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, you don<U+2019>t pipe your eye and look squally when I sheer off as you&nbsp; used to, and that<U+2019>s a comfort. I like to leave port in fair weather and&nbsp; have a jolly send-off all round. Specially this time, for it will be a&nbsp; year or more before we drop anchor here again,<U+2019> answered Emil, pushing&nbsp; his cap back, and glancing about him as if he loved old Plum and would&nbsp; be sorry never to see it any more.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You have salt water enough without my adding to it. I<U+2019>m going to be&nbsp; quite a Spartan mother, and send my sons to battle with no wailing, only&nbsp; the command:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+201C>With your shield or on it<U+201D>,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo cheerfully, adding after a&nbsp; pause: <U+2018>I often wish I could go too, and some day I will, when you are&nbsp; captain and have a ship of your own--as I<U+2019>ve no doubt you will before&nbsp; long, with Uncle Herman to push you on.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>When I do I<U+2019>ll christen her the Jolly Jo and take you as first mate.&nbsp; It would be regular larks to have you aboard, and I<U+2019>d be a proud man to&nbsp; carry you round the world you<U+2019>ve wanted to see so long and never could,<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Emil, caught at once by this splendid vision.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll make my first voyage with you and enjoy myself immensely in spite&nbsp; of seasickness and all the stormy winds that blow. I<U+2019>ve always thought&nbsp; I<U+2019>d like to see a wreck, a nice safe one with all saved after great&nbsp; danger and heroic deeds, while we clung like Mr Pillicoddy to main-top&nbsp; jibs and lee scuppers.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No wrecks yet, ma<U+2019>am, but we<U+2019>ll try to accommodate customers. Captain&nbsp; says I<U+2019>m a lucky dog and bring fair weather, so we<U+2019>ll save the dirty&nbsp; weather for you if you want it,<U+2019> laughed Emil, digging at the ship in&nbsp; full sail which he was adding to his design.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thanks, I hope you will. This long voyage will give you new&nbsp; experiences, and being an officer, you will have new duties and&nbsp; responsibilities. Are you ready for them? You take everything so gaily,&nbsp; I<U+2019>ve been wondering if you realized that now you will have not only to&nbsp; obey but to command also, and power is a dangerous thing. Be careful&nbsp; that you don<U+2019>t abuse it or let it make a tyrant of you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Right you are, ma<U+2019>am. I<U+2019>ve seen plenty of that, and have got my&nbsp; bearings pretty well, I guess. I shan<U+2019>t have very wide swing with Peters&nbsp; over me, but I<U+2019>ll see that the boys don<U+2019>t get abused when he<U+2019>s bowsed up&nbsp; his jib. No right to speak before, but now I won<U+2019>t stand it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That sounds mysteriously awful; could I ask what nautical torture&nbsp; <U+201C>bowsing jibs<U+201D> is?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, in a tone of deep interest.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Getting drunk. Peters can hold more grog than any man I ever saw; he&nbsp; keeps right side up, but is as savage as a norther, and makes things&nbsp; lively all round. I<U+2019>ve seen him knock a fellow down with a belaying pin,&nbsp; and couldn<U+2019>t lend a hand. Better luck now, I hope.<U+2019> And Emil frowned as&nbsp; if he already trod the quarter-deck, lord of all he surveyed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t get into trouble, for even Uncle Herman<U+2019>s favour won<U+2019>t cover&nbsp; insubordination, you know. You have proved yourself a good sailor; now&nbsp; be a good officer, which is a harder thing, I fancy. It takes a fine&nbsp; character to rule justly and kindly; you will have to put by your boyish&nbsp; ways and remember your dignity. That will be excellent training for you,&nbsp; Emil, and sober you down a bit. No more skylarking except here, so mind&nbsp; your ways, and do honour to your buttons,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, tapping one&nbsp; of the very bright brass ones that ornamented the new suit Emil was so&nbsp; proud of.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll do my best. I know my time for skirmshander (chaff) is over, and&nbsp; I must steer a straighter course; but don<U+2019>t you fear, Jack ashore is a&nbsp; very different craft from what he is with blue water under his keel. I&nbsp; had a long talk with Uncle last night and got my orders; I won<U+2019>t forget&nbsp; <U+2018>em nor all I owe him. As for you, I<U+2019>ll name my first ship as I say, and&nbsp; have your bust for the figurehead, see if I don<U+2019>t,<U+2019> and Emil gave his&nbsp; aunt a hearty kiss to seal the vow, which proceeding much amused Nat,&nbsp; playing softly in the porch of the Dovecote.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You do me proud, Captain. But, dear, I want to say one thing and then&nbsp; I<U+2019>m done; for you don<U+2019>t need much advice of mine after my good man has&nbsp; spoken. I read somewhere that every inch of rope used in the British&nbsp; Navy has a strand of red in it, so that wherever a bit of it is found&nbsp; it is known. That is the text of my little sermon to you. Virtue, which&nbsp; means honour, honesty, courage, and all that makes character, is the&nbsp; red thread that marks a good man wherever he is. Keep that always and&nbsp; everywhere, so that even if wrecked by misfortune, that sign shall still&nbsp; be found and recognized. Yours is a rough life, and your mates not all&nbsp; we could wish, but you can be a gentleman in the true sense of the word;&nbsp; and no matter what happens to your body, keep your soul clean, your&nbsp; heart true to those who love you, and do your duty to the end.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As she spoke Emil had risen and stood listening with his cap off and a&nbsp; grave, bright look as if taking orders from a superior officer; when she&nbsp; ended, he answered briefly, but heartily:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Please God, I will!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s all; I have little fear for you, but one never knows when or how&nbsp; the weak moment may come, and sometimes a chance word helps us, as so&nbsp; many my dear mother spoke come back to me now for my own comfort and the&nbsp; guidance of my boys,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, rising; for the words had been said&nbsp; and no more were needed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve stored <U+2018>em up and know where to find <U+2018>em when wanted. Often and&nbsp; often in my watch I<U+2019>ve seen old Plum, and heard you and Uncle talking&nbsp; so plainly, I<U+2019>d have sworn I was here. It is a rough life, Aunty, but&nbsp; a wholesome one if a fellow loves it as I do, and has an anchor to&nbsp; windward as I have. Don<U+2019>t worry about me, and I<U+2019>ll come home next year&nbsp; with a chest of tea that will cheer your heart and give you ideas enough&nbsp; for a dozen novels. Going below? All right, steady in the gangway! I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; be along by the time you<U+2019>ve got out the cake-box. Last chance for a good&nbsp; old lunch ashore.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo descended laughing, and Emil finished his ship whistling&nbsp; cheerfully, neither dreaming when and where this little chat on the&nbsp; house-top would return to the memory of one of them.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan was harder to catch, and not until evening did a quiet moment come&nbsp; in that busy family; when, while the rest were roaming about, Mrs Jo sat&nbsp; down to read in the study, and presently Dan looked in at the window.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come and rest after your long tramp; you must be tired,<U+2019> she called,&nbsp; with an inviting nod towards the big sofa where so many boys had&nbsp; reposed--as much as that active animal ever does.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Afraid I shall disturb you<U+2019>; but Dan looked as if he wanted to stay his&nbsp; restless feet somewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not a bit; I<U+2019>m always ready to talk, shouldn<U+2019>t be a woman if I were&nbsp; not,<U+2019> laughed Mrs Jo, as Dan swung himself in and sat down with an air&nbsp; of contentment very pleasant to see.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Last day is over, yet somehow I don<U+2019>t seem to hanker to be off.&nbsp; Generally, I<U+2019>m rather anxious to cut loose after a short stop. Odd,&nbsp; ain<U+2019>t it?<U+2019> asked Dan, gravely picking grass and leaves out of his hair&nbsp; and beard; for he had been lying on the grass, thinking many thoughts in&nbsp; the quiet summer night.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not at all; you are beginning to get civilized. It<U+2019>s a good sign, and&nbsp; I<U+2019>m glad to see it,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo promptly. <U+2018>You<U+2019>ve had your swing,&nbsp; and want a change. Hope the farming will give it to you, though helping&nbsp; the Indians pleases me more: it is so much better to work for others&nbsp; than for one<U+2019>s self alone.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So <U+2018>tis,<U+2019> assented Dan heartily. <U+2018>I seem to want to root somewhere&nbsp; and have folks of my own to take care of. Tired of my own company, I&nbsp; suppose, now I<U+2019>ve seen so much better. I<U+2019>m a rough, ignorant lot, and&nbsp; I<U+2019>ve been thinking maybe I<U+2019>ve missed it loafing round creation, instead&nbsp; of going in for education as the other chaps did. Hey?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; He looked anxiously at Mrs Jo; and she tried to hide the surprise this&nbsp; new outburst caused her; for till now Dan had scorned books and gloried&nbsp; in his freedom.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No; I don<U+2019>t think so in your case. So far I<U+2019>m sure the free life was&nbsp; best. Now that you are a man you can control that lawless nature better;&nbsp; but as a boy only great activity and much adventure could keep you out&nbsp; of mischief. Time is taming my colt, you see, and I shall yet be proud&nbsp; of him, whether he makes a pack-horse of himself to carry help to the&nbsp; starving or goes to ploughing as Pegasus did.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan liked the comparison, and smiled as he lounged in the sofa-corner,&nbsp; with the new thoughtfulness in his eyes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Glad you think so. The fact is it<U+2019>s going to take a heap of taming to&nbsp; make me go well in harness anywhere. I want to, and I try now and then,&nbsp; but always kick over the traces and run away. No lives lost yet; but I&nbsp; shouldn<U+2019>t wonder if there was some time, and a general smash-up.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Why, Dan, did you have any dangerous adventures during this last&nbsp; absence? I fancied so, but didn<U+2019>t ask before, knowing you<U+2019>d tell me if I&nbsp; could help in any way. Can I?<U+2019> And Mrs Jo looked anxiously at him; for a&nbsp; sudden lowering expression had come into his face, and he leaned forward&nbsp; as if to hide it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Nothing very bad; but <U+2018>Frisco isn<U+2019>t just a heaven on earth, you know,&nbsp; and it<U+2019>s harder to be a saint there than here,<U+2019> he answered slowly;&nbsp; then, as if he had made up his mind to <U+2018><U+2019>fess<U+2019>, as the children used to&nbsp; say, he sat up, and added rapidly, in a half-defiant, half-shamefaced&nbsp; way, <U+2018>I tried gambling, and it wasn<U+2019>t good for me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Was that how you made your money?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not a penny of it! That<U+2019>s all honest, if speculation isn<U+2019>t a bigger&nbsp; sort of gambling. I won a lot; but I lost or gave it away, and cut the&nbsp; whole concern before it got the better of me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thank heaven for that! Don<U+2019>t try it again; it may have the terrible&nbsp; fascination for you it has for so many. Keep to your mountains and&nbsp; prairies, and shun cities, if these things tempt you, Dan. Better lose&nbsp; your life than your soul, and one such passion leads to worse sins, as&nbsp; you know better than I.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan nodded, and seeing how troubled she was, said, in a lighter tone,&nbsp; though still the shadow of that past experience remained:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t be scared; I<U+2019>m all right now; and a burnt dog dreads the fire. I&nbsp; don<U+2019>t drink, or do the things you dread; don<U+2019>t care for <U+2018>em; but I&nbsp; get excited, and then this devilish temper of mine is more than I can&nbsp; manage. Fighting a moose or a buffalo is all right; but when you pitch&nbsp; into a man, no matter how great a scamp he is, you<U+2019>ve got to look out.&nbsp; I shall kill someone some day; that<U+2019>s all I<U+2019>m afraid of. I do hate a&nbsp; sneak!<U+2019> And Dan brought his fist down on the table with a blow that made&nbsp; the lamp totter and the books skip.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That always was your trial, Dan, and I can sympathize with you; for&nbsp; I<U+2019>ve been trying to govern my own temper all my life, and haven<U+2019>t learnt&nbsp; yet,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, with a sigh. <U+2018>For heaven<U+2019>s sake, guard your demon&nbsp; well, and don<U+2019>t let a moment<U+2019>s fury ruin all your life. As I said to&nbsp; Nat, watch and pray, my dear boy. There is no other help or hope for&nbsp; human weakness but God<U+2019>s love and patience.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tears were in Mrs Jo<U+2019>s eyes as she spoke; for she felt this deeply, and&nbsp; knew how hard a task it is to rule these bosom sins of ours. Dan looked&nbsp; touched, also uncomfortable, as he always did when religion of any sort&nbsp; was mentioned, though he had a simple creed of his own, and tried to&nbsp; live up to it in his blind way.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t do much praying; don<U+2019>t seem to come handy to me; but I can&nbsp; watch like a redskin, only it<U+2019>s easier to mount guard over a lurking&nbsp; grizzly than my own cursed temper. It<U+2019>s that I<U+2019>m afraid of, if I settle&nbsp; down. I can get on with wild beasts first-rate; but men rile me awfully,&nbsp; and I can<U+2019>t take it out in a free fight, as I can with a bear or a&nbsp; wolf. Guess I<U+2019>d better head for the Rockies, and stay there a spell&nbsp; longer--till I<U+2019>m tame enough for decent folks, if I ever am.<U+2019> And Dan&nbsp; leaned his rough head on his hands in a despondent attitude.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Try my sort of help, and don<U+2019>t give up. Read more, study a little, and&nbsp; try to meet a better class of people, who won<U+2019>t <U+201C>rile<U+201D>, but soothe and&nbsp; strengthen you. We don<U+2019>t make you savage, I<U+2019>m sure; for you have been as&nbsp; meek as a lamb, and made us very happy.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Glad of it; but I<U+2019>ve felt like a hawk in a hen-house all the same,&nbsp; and wanted to pounce and tear more than once. Not so much as I used,&nbsp; though,<U+2019> added Dan, after a short laugh at Mrs Jo<U+2019>s surprised face.&nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll try your plan, and keep good company this bout if I can; but a man&nbsp; can<U+2019>t pick and choose, knocking about as I do.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, you can this time; for you are going on a peaceful errand and can&nbsp; keep clear of temptation if you try. Take some books and read; that<U+2019>s&nbsp; an immense help; and books are always good company if you have the right&nbsp; sort. Let me pick out some for you.<U+2019> And Mrs Jo made a bee-line to the&nbsp; well-laden shelves, which were the joy of her heart and the comfort of&nbsp; her life.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Give me travels and stories, please; don<U+2019>t want any pious works, can<U+2019>t&nbsp; seem to relish <U+2018>em, and won<U+2019>t pretend I do,<U+2019> said Dan, following to look&nbsp; over her head with small favour at the long lines of well-worn volumes.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo turned short round, and putting a hand on either broad shoulder,&nbsp; looked him in the eye, saying soberly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now, Dan, see here; never sneer at good things or pretend to be worse&nbsp; than you are. Don<U+2019>t let false shame make you neglect the religion&nbsp; without which no man can live. You needn<U+2019>t talk about it if you don<U+2019>t&nbsp; like, but don<U+2019>t shut your heart to it in whatever shape it comes. Nature&nbsp; is your God now; she has done much for you; let her do more, and lead&nbsp; you to know and love a wiser and more tender teacher, friend, and&nbsp; comforter than she can ever be. That is your only hope; don<U+2019>t throw it&nbsp; away, and waste time; for sooner or later you will feel the need of Him,&nbsp; and He will come to you and hold you up when all other help fails.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan stood motionless, and let her read in his softened eyes the dumb&nbsp; desire that lived in his heart, though he had no words to tell it,&nbsp; and only permitted her to catch a glimpse of the divine spark which&nbsp; smoulders or burns clearly in every human soul. He did not speak; and&nbsp; glad to be spared some answer which should belie his real feelings, Mrs&nbsp; Jo hastened to say, with her most motherly smile:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I saw in your room the little Bible I gave you long ago; it was well&nbsp; worn outside, but fresh within, as if not much read. Will you promise me&nbsp; to read a little once a week, dear, for my sake? Sunday is a quiet day&nbsp; everywhere, and this book is never old nor out of place. Begin with the&nbsp; stories you used to love when I told them to you boys. David was your&nbsp; favourite, you remember? Read him again; he<U+2019>ll suit you even better now,&nbsp; and you<U+2019>ll find his sins and repentance useful reading till you come to&nbsp; the life and work of a diviner example than he. You will do it, for&nbsp; love of mother Bhaer, who always loved her <U+201C>firebrand<U+201D> and hoped to save&nbsp; him?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will,<U+2019> answered Dan, with a sudden brightening of face that was like&nbsp; a sunburst through a cloud, full of promise though so short-lived and&nbsp; rare.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo turned at once to the books and began to talk of them, knowing&nbsp; well that Dan would not hear any more just then. He seemed relieved; for&nbsp; it was always hard for him to show his inner self, and he took pride in&nbsp; hiding it as an Indian does in concealing pain or fear.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hallo, here<U+2019>s old Sintram! I remember him; used to like him and his&nbsp; tantrums, and read about <U+2018>em to Ted. There he is riding ahead with Death&nbsp; and the Devil alongside.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As Dan looked at the little picture of the young man with horse and&nbsp; hound going bravely up the rocky defile, accompanied by the companions&nbsp; who ride beside most men through this world, a curious impulse made Mrs&nbsp; Jo say quickly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s you, Dan, just you at this time! Danger and sin are near you in&nbsp; the life you lead; moods and passions torment you; the bad father left&nbsp; you to fight alone, and the wild spirit drives you to wander up and down&nbsp; the world looking for peace and self-control. Even the horse and hound&nbsp; are there, your Octoo and Don, faithful friends, unscared by the strange&nbsp; mates that go with you. You have not got the armour yet, but I<U+2019>m trying&nbsp; to show you where to find it. Remember the mother Sintram loved and&nbsp; longed to find, and did find when his battle was bravely fought, his&nbsp; reward well earned? You can recollect your mother; and I have always&nbsp; felt that all the good qualities you possess come from her. Act out the&nbsp; beautiful old story in this as in the other parts, and try to give her&nbsp; back a son to be proud of.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite carried away by the likeness of the quaint tale to Dan<U+2019>s life and&nbsp; needs, Mrs Jo went on pointing to the various pictures which illustrated&nbsp; it, and when she looked up was surprised to see how struck and&nbsp; interested he seemed to be. Like all people of his temperament he was&nbsp; very impressionable, and his life among hunters and Indians had made him&nbsp; superstitious; he believed in dreams, liked weird tales, and whatever&nbsp; appealed to the eye or mind, vividly impressed him more than the wisest&nbsp; words. The story of poor, tormented Sintram came back clearly as he&nbsp; looked and listened, symbolizing his secret trials even more truly than&nbsp; Mrs Jo knew; and just at that moment this had an effect upon him that&nbsp; never was forgotten. But all he said was:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Small chance of that. I don<U+2019>t take much stock in the idea of meeting&nbsp; folks in heaven. Guess mother won<U+2019>t remember the poor little brat she&nbsp; left so long ago; why should she?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Because true mothers never forget their children; and I know she was&nbsp; one, from the fact that she ran away from the cruel husband, to save&nbsp; her little son from bad influences. Had she lived, life would have been&nbsp; happier for you, with this tender friend to help and comfort you. Never&nbsp; forget that she risked everything for your sake, and don<U+2019>t let it be in&nbsp; vain.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo spoke very earnestly, knowing that this was the one sweet memory&nbsp; of Dan<U+2019>s early life, and glad to have recalled it at this moment; for&nbsp; suddenly a great tear splashed down on the page where Sintram kneels&nbsp; at his mother<U+2019>s feet, wounded, but victorious over sin and death. She&nbsp; looked up, well pleased to have touched Dan to the heart<U+2019>s core, as that&nbsp; drop proved; but a sweep of the arm brushed away the tell-tale, and his&nbsp; beard hid the mate to it, as he shut the book, saying with a suppressed&nbsp; quiver in his strong voice:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll keep this, if nobody wants it. I<U+2019>ll read it over, and maybe it&nbsp; will do me good. I<U+2019>d like to meet her anywhere, but don<U+2019>t believe I ever&nbsp; shall.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Keep it and welcome. My mother gave it to me; and when you read it try&nbsp; to believe that neither of your mothers will ever forget you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo gave the book with a caress; and simply saying: <U+2018>Thanks; good&nbsp; night,<U+2019> Dan thrust it into his pocket, and walked straight away to the&nbsp; river to recover from this unwonted mood of tenderness and confidence.&nbsp; &nbsp; Next day the travellers were off. All were in good spirits, and a cloud&nbsp; of handkerchiefs whitened the air as they drove away in the old bus,&nbsp; waving their hats to everyone and kissing their hands, especially to&nbsp; mother Bhaer, who said in her prophetic tone as she wiped her eyes, when&nbsp; the familiar rumble died away:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have a feeling that something is going to happen to some of them, and&nbsp; they will never come back to me, or come back changed. Well, I can only&nbsp; say, God be with my boys!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; And He was.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 7. THE LION AND THE LAMB&nbsp; &nbsp; When the boys were gone a lull fell upon Plumfield, and the family&nbsp; scattered to various places for brief outings, as August had come and&nbsp; all felt the need of change. The Professor took Mrs Jo to the mountains.&nbsp; The Laurences were at the seashore, and there Meg<U+2019>s family and the Bhaer&nbsp; boys took turns to visit, as someone must always be at home to keep&nbsp; things in order.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Meg, with Daisy, was in office when the events occurred which we are&nbsp; about to relate. Rob and Ted were just up from Rocky Nook, and Nan&nbsp; was passing a week with her friend as the only relaxation she allowed&nbsp; herself. Demi was off on a run with Tom, so Rob was man of the house,&nbsp; with old Silas as general overseer. The sea air seemed to have gone to&nbsp; Ted<U+2019>s head, for he was unusually freakish, and led his gentle aunt and&nbsp; poor Rob a life of it with his pranks. Octoo was worn out with the wild&nbsp; rides he took, and Don openly rebelled when ordered to leap and show&nbsp; off his accomplishments; while the girls at college were both amused and&nbsp; worried by the ghosts who haunted the grounds at night, the unearthly&nbsp; melodies that disturbed their studious hours, and the hairbreadth&nbsp; escapes of this restless boy by flood and field and fire. Something&nbsp; happened at length which effectually sobered Ted and made a lasting&nbsp; impression on both the boys; for sudden danger and a haunting fear&nbsp; turned the Lion into a lamb and the Lamb into a lion, as far as courage&nbsp; went.&nbsp; &nbsp; On the first of September--the boys never forgot the date--after a&nbsp; pleasant tramp and good luck with their fishing, the brothers were&nbsp; lounging in the barn; for Daisy had company, and the lads kept out of&nbsp; the way.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I tell you what it is, Bobby, that dog is sick. He won<U+2019>t play, nor eat,&nbsp; nor drink, and acts queerly. Dan will kill us if anything happens to&nbsp; him,<U+2019> said Ted, looking at Don, who lay near his kennel resting a moment&nbsp; after one of the restless wanderings which kept him vibrating between&nbsp; the door of Dan<U+2019>s room and the shady corner of the yard, where his&nbsp; master had settled him with an old cap to guard till he came back.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s the hot weather, perhaps. But I sometimes think he<U+2019>s pining for&nbsp; Dan. Dogs do, you know, and the poor fellow has been low in his mind&nbsp; ever since the boys went. Maybe something has happened to Dan. Don&nbsp; howled last night and can<U+2019>t rest. I<U+2019>ve heard of such things,<U+2019> answered&nbsp; Rob thoughtfully.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Pooh! he can<U+2019>t know. He<U+2019>s cross. I<U+2019>ll stir him up and take him for a&nbsp; run. Always makes me feel better. Hi, boy! wake up and be jolly<U+2019>; and&nbsp; Ted snapped his fingers at the dog, who only looked at him with grim&nbsp; indifference.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Better let him alone. If he isn<U+2019>t right tomorrow, we<U+2019>ll take him to Dr&nbsp; Watkins and see what he says.<U+2019> And Rob went on watching the swallows as&nbsp; he lay in the hay polishing up some Latin verses he had made.&nbsp; &nbsp; The spirit of perversity entered into Ted, and merely because he was&nbsp; told not to tease Don he went on doing it, pretending that it was for&nbsp; the dog<U+2019>s good. Don took no heed of his pats, commands, reproaches, or&nbsp; insults, till Ted<U+2019>s patience gave out; and seeing a convenient switch&nbsp; near by he could not resist the temptation to conquer the great hound&nbsp; by force, since gentleness failed to win obedience. He had the wisdom to&nbsp; chain Don up first; for a blow from any hand but his master<U+2019>s made him&nbsp; savage, and Ted had more than once tried the experiment, as the dog&nbsp; remembered. This indignity roused Don and he sat up with a growl. Rob&nbsp; heard it, and seeing Ted raise the switch, ran to interfere, exclaiming:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t touch him! Dan forbade it! Leave the poor thing in peace; I won<U+2019>t&nbsp; allow it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob seldom commanded, but when he did Master Ted had to give in. His&nbsp; temper was up, and Rob<U+2019>s masterful tone made it impossible to resist one&nbsp; cut at the rebellious dog before he submitted. Only a single blow, but&nbsp; it was a costly one; for as it fell, the dog sprang at Ted with a snarl,&nbsp; and Rob, rushing between the two, felt the sharp teeth pierce his leg.&nbsp; A word made Don let go and drop remorsefully at Rob<U+2019>s feet, for he loved&nbsp; him and was evidently sorry to have hurt his friend by mistake. With a&nbsp; forgiving pat Rob left him, to limp to the barn followed by Ted, whose&nbsp; wrath was changed to shame and sorrow when he saw the red drops on Rob<U+2019>s&nbsp; sock and the little wounds in his leg.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m awfully sorry. Why did you get in the way? Here, wash it up, and&nbsp; I<U+2019>ll get a rag to tie on it,<U+2019> he said quickly filling a sponge with&nbsp; water and pulling out a very demoralized handkerchief. Rob usually made&nbsp; light of his own mishaps and was over ready to forgive if others were to&nbsp; blame; but now he sat quite still, looking at the purple marks with such&nbsp; a strange expression on his white face that Ted was troubled, though he&nbsp; added with a laugh: <U+2018>Why, you<U+2019>re not afraid of a little dig like that,&nbsp; are you, Bobby?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I am afraid of hydrophobia. But if Don is mad I<U+2019>d rather be the one to&nbsp; have it,<U+2019> answered Rob, with a smile and a shiver.&nbsp; &nbsp; At that dreadful word Ted turned whiter than his brother, and,&nbsp; dropping sponge and handkerchief, stared at him with a frightened face,&nbsp; whispering in a tone of despair:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, Rob, don<U+2019>t say it! What shall we do, what shall we do?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Call Nan; she will know. Don<U+2019>t scare Aunty, or tell a soul but Nan;&nbsp; she<U+2019>s on the back piazza; get her out here as quick as you can. I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; wash it till she comes. Maybe it<U+2019>s nothing; don<U+2019>t look so staggered,&nbsp; Ted. I only thought it might be, as Don is queer.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob tried to speak bravely; but Ted<U+2019>s long legs felt strangely weak as&nbsp; he hurried away, and it was lucky he met no one, for his face would have&nbsp; betrayed him. Nan was swinging luxuriously in a hammock, amusing herself&nbsp; with a lively treatise on croup, when an agitated boy suddenly clutched&nbsp; her, whispering, as he nearly pulled her overboard:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come to Rob in the barn! Don<U+2019>s mad and he<U+2019>s bitten him, and we don<U+2019>t&nbsp; know what to do; it<U+2019>s all my fault; no one must know. Oh, do be quick!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan was on her feet at once, startled, but with her wits about her, and&nbsp; both were off without more words as they dodged round the house where&nbsp; unconscious Daisy chatted with her friends in the parlour and Aunt Meg&nbsp; peacefully took her afternoon nap upstairs.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob was braced up, and was as calm and steady as ever when they found&nbsp; him in the harness-room, whither he had wisely retired, to escape&nbsp; observation. The story was soon told, and after a look at Don, now in&nbsp; his kennel, sad and surly, Nan said slowly, with her eye on the full&nbsp; water-pan:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Rob, there is one thing to do for the sake of safety, and it must&nbsp; be done at once. We can<U+2019>t wait to see if Don is--sick--or to go for a&nbsp; doctor. I can do it, and I will; but it is very painful, and I hate to&nbsp; hurt you, dear.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; A most unprofessional quiver got into Nan<U+2019>s voice as she spoke, and her&nbsp; keen eyes dimmed as she looked at the two anxious young faces turned so&nbsp; confidingly to her for help.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know, burn it; well, do it, please; I can bear it. But Ted better&nbsp; go away,<U+2019> said Rob, with a firm setting of his lips, and a nod at his&nbsp; afflicted brother.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I won<U+2019>t stir; I can stand it if he can, only it ought to be me!<U+2019> cried&nbsp; Ted, with a desperate effort not to cry, so full of grief and fear and&nbsp; shame was he that it seemed as if he couldn<U+2019>t bear it like a man.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He<U+2019>d better stay and help; do him good,<U+2019> answered&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan sternly, because, her heart was faint within her, knowing as she did&nbsp; all that might be in store for both poor boys. <U+2018>Keep quiet; I<U+2019>ll be back&nbsp; in a minute,<U+2019> she added, going towards the house, while her quick mind&nbsp; hastily planned what was best to be done.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was ironing day, and a hot fire still burned in the empty kitchen,&nbsp; for the maids were upstairs resting. Nan put a slender poker to heat,&nbsp; and as she sat waiting for it, covered her face with her hands, asking&nbsp; help in this sudden need for strength, courage, and wisdom; for there&nbsp; was no one else to call upon, and young as she was, she knew what was to&nbsp; be done if she only had the nerve to do it. Any other patient would have&nbsp; been calmly interesting, but dear, good Robin, his father<U+2019>s pride, his&nbsp; mother<U+2019>s comfort, everyone<U+2019>s favourite and friend, that he should be&nbsp; in danger was very terrible; and a few hot tears dropped on the&nbsp; well-scoured table as Nan tried to calm her trouble by remembering how&nbsp; very likely it was to be all a mistake, a natural but vain alarm.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I must make light of it, or the boys will break down, and then there&nbsp; will be a panic. Why afflict and frighten everyone when all is in doubt?&nbsp; I won<U+2019>t. I<U+2019>ll take Rob to Dr Morrison at once, and have the dog man see&nbsp; Don. Then, having done all we can, we will either laugh at our scare--if&nbsp; it is one--or be ready for whatever comes. Now for my poor boy.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Armed with the red-hot poker, a pitcher of ice-water, and several&nbsp; handkerchiefs from the clotheshorse, Nan went back to the barn ready to&nbsp; do her best in this her most serious <U+2018>emergency case<U+2019>. The boys sat like&nbsp; statues, one of despair, the other of resignation; and it took all Nan<U+2019>s&nbsp; boasted nerve to do her work quickly and well.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now, Rob, only a minute, then we are safe. Stand by, Ted; he may be a&nbsp; bit faintish.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob shut his eyes, clinched his hands, and sat like a hero. Ted knelt&nbsp; beside him, white as a sheet, and as weak as a girl; for the pangs of&nbsp; remorse were rending him, and his heart failed at the thought of all&nbsp; this pain because of his wilfulness. It was all over in a moment, with&nbsp; only one little groan; but when Nan looked to her assistant to hand the&nbsp; water, poor Ted needed it the most, for he had fainted away, and lay on&nbsp; the floor in a pathetic heap of arms and legs.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob laughed, and, cheered by that unexpected sound, Nan bound up the&nbsp; wound with hands that never trembled, though great drops stood on her&nbsp; forehead; and she shared the water with patient number one before she&nbsp; turned to patient number two. Ted was much ashamed, and quite broken&nbsp; in spirit, when he found how he had failed at the critical moment, and&nbsp; begged them not to tell, as he really could not help it; then by way of&nbsp; finishing his utter humiliation, a burst of hysterical tears disgraced&nbsp; his manly soul, and did him a world of good.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Never mind, never mind, we are all right now, and no one need be the&nbsp; wiser,<U+2019> said Nan briskly, as poor Ted hiccoughed on Rob<U+2019>s shoulder,&nbsp; laughing and crying in the most tempestuous manner, while his brother&nbsp; soothed him, and the young doctor fanned both with Silas<U+2019>s old straw&nbsp; hat.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now, boys, listen to me and remember what I say. We won<U+2019>t alarm anyone&nbsp; yet, for I<U+2019>ve made up my mind our scare is all nonsense. Don was out&nbsp; lapping the water as I came by, and I don<U+2019>t believe he<U+2019>s mad any more&nbsp; than I am. Still, to ease our minds and compose our spirits, and get our&nbsp; guilty faces out of sight for a while, I think we had better drive into&nbsp; town to my old friend Dr Morrison, and let him just take a look at&nbsp; my work, and give us some quieting little dose; for we are all rather&nbsp; shaken by this flurry. Sit still, Rob; and Ted, you harness up while I&nbsp; run and get my hat and tell Aunty to excuse me to Daisy. I don<U+2019>t know&nbsp; those Penniman girls, and she will be glad of our room at tea, and we<U+2019>ll&nbsp; have a cosy bite at my house, and come home as gay as larks.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan talked on as a vent for the hidden emotions which professional pride&nbsp; would not allow her to show, and the boys approved her plan at once; for&nbsp; action is always easier than quiet waiting. Ted went staggering away to&nbsp; wash his face at the pump, and rub some colour into his cheeks before&nbsp; he harnessed the horse. Rob lay tranquilly on the hay, looking up at the&nbsp; swallows again as he lived through some very memorable moments. Boy as&nbsp; he was, the thought of death coming suddenly to him, and in this way,&nbsp; might well make him sober; for it is a very solemn thing to be arrested&nbsp; in the midst of busy life by the possibility of the great change. There&nbsp; were no sins to be repented of, few faults, and many happy, dutiful&nbsp; years to remember with infinite comfort. So Rob had no fears to daunt&nbsp; him, no regrets to sadden, and best of all, a very strong and simple&nbsp; piety to sustain and cheer him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mein Vater,<U+2019> was his first thought; for Rob was very near the&nbsp; Professor<U+2019>s heart, and the loss of his eldest would have been a bitter&nbsp; blow. These words, whispered with a tremble of the lips that had been so&nbsp; firm when the hot iron burned, recalled that other Father who is always&nbsp; near, always tender and helpful; and, folding his hands, Rob said the&nbsp; heartiest little prayer he ever prayed, there on the hay, to the soft&nbsp; twitter of the brooding birds. It did him good; and wisely laying all&nbsp; his fear and doubt and trouble in God<U+2019>s hand, the boy felt ready for&nbsp; whatever was to come, and from that hour kept steadily before him the&nbsp; one duty that was plain--to be brave and cheerful, keep silent, and hope&nbsp; for the best.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan stole her hat, and left a note on Daisy<U+2019>s pincushion, saying she had&nbsp; taken the boys to drive, and all would be out of the way till after tea.&nbsp; Then she hurried back and found her patients much better, the one for&nbsp; work, the other for rest. In they got, and, putting Rob on the back seat&nbsp; with his leg up drove away, looking as gay and care-free as if nothing&nbsp; had happened.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr Morrison made light of the affair, but told Nan she had done right;&nbsp; and as the much-relieved lads went downstairs, he added in a whisper:&nbsp; <U+2018>Send the dog off for a while, and keep your eye on the boy. Don<U+2019>t let&nbsp; him know it, and report to me if anything seems wrong. One never knows&nbsp; in these cases. No harm to be careful.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan nodded, and feeling much relieved now that the responsibility was&nbsp; off her shoulders, took the lads to Dr Watkins, who promised to come out&nbsp; later and examine Don. A merry tea at Nan<U+2019>s house, which was kept open&nbsp; for her all summer, did them good, and by the time they got home in the&nbsp; cool of the evening no sign of the panic remained but Ted<U+2019>s heavy eyes,&nbsp; and a slight limp when Rob walked. As the guests were still chattering&nbsp; on the front piazza they retired to the back, and Ted soothed his&nbsp; remorseful soul by swinging Rob in the hammock, while Nan told stories&nbsp; till the dog man arrived.&nbsp; &nbsp; He said Don was a little under the weather, but no more mad than the&nbsp; grey kitten that purred round his legs while the examination went on.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He wants his master, and feels the heat. Fed too well, perhaps. I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; keep him a few weeks and send him home all right,<U+2019> said Dr Watkins, as&nbsp; Don laid his great head in his hand, and kept his intelligent eyes on&nbsp; his face, evidently feeling that this man understood his trials, and&nbsp; knew what to do for him.&nbsp; &nbsp; So Don departed without a murmur, and our three conspirators took&nbsp; counsel together how to spare the family all anxiety, and give Rob the&nbsp; rest his leg demanded. Fortunately, he always spent many hours in his&nbsp; little study, so he could lie on the sofa with a book in his hand&nbsp; as long as he liked, without exciting any remark. Being of a quiet&nbsp; temperament, he did not worry himself or Nan with useless fears, but&nbsp; believed what was told him, and dismissing all dark possibilities, went&nbsp; cheerfully on his way, soon recovering from the shock of what he called&nbsp; <U+2018>our scare<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; But excitable Ted was harder to manage, and it took all Nan<U+2019>s wit and&nbsp; wisdom to keep him from betraying the secret; for it was best to say&nbsp; nothing and spare all discussion of the subject for Rob<U+2019>s sake. Ted<U+2019>s&nbsp; remorse preyed upon him, and having no <U+2018>Mum<U+2019> to confide in, he was very&nbsp; miserable. By day he devoted himself to Rob, waiting on him, talking to&nbsp; him, gazing anxiously at him, and worrying the good fellow very much;&nbsp; though he wouldn<U+2019>t own it, since Ted found comfort in it. But at night,&nbsp; when all was quiet, Ted<U+2019>s lively imagination and heavy heart got the&nbsp; better of him, and kept him awake, or set him walking in his sleep. Nan&nbsp; had her eye on him, and more than once administered a little dose to&nbsp; give him a rest, read to him, scolded him, and when she caught him&nbsp; haunting the house in the watches of the night, threatened to lock him&nbsp; up if he did not stay in his bed. This wore off after a while; but a&nbsp; change came over the freakish boy, and everyone observed it, even before&nbsp; his mother returned to ask what they had done to quench the Lion<U+2019>s&nbsp; spirits. He was gay, but not so heedless; and often when the old&nbsp; wilfulness beset him, he would check it sharply, look at Rob, and give&nbsp; up, or stalk away to have his sulk out alone. He no longer made fun of&nbsp; his brother<U+2019>s old-fashioned ways and bookish tastes, but treated him&nbsp; with a new and very marked respect, which touched and pleased modest&nbsp; Rob, and much amazed all observers. It seemed as if he felt that he owed&nbsp; him reparation for the foolish act that might have cost him his life;&nbsp; and love being stronger than will, Ted forgot his pride, and paid his&nbsp; debt like an honest boy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t understand it,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, after a week of home life, much&nbsp; impressed by the good behaviour of her younger son. <U+2018>Ted is such a&nbsp; saint, I<U+2019>m afraid we are going to lose him. Is it Meg<U+2019>s sweet influence,&nbsp; or Daisy<U+2019>s fine cooking, or the pellets I catch Nan giving him on&nbsp; the sly? Some witchcraft has been at work during my absence, and this&nbsp; will-o<U+2019>-the-wisp is so amiable, quiet, and obedient, I don<U+2019>t know him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He is growing up, heart<U+2019>s-dearest, and being a precocious plant, he&nbsp; begins to bloom early. I also see a change in my Robchen. He is more&nbsp; manly and serious than ever, and is seldom far from me, as if his&nbsp; love for the old papa was growing with his growth. Our boys will often&nbsp; surprise us in this way, Jo, and we can only rejoice over them and leave&nbsp; them to become what Gott pleases.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As the Professor spoke, his eyes rested proudly on the brothers, who&nbsp; came walking up the steps together, Ted<U+2019>s arm over Rob<U+2019>s shoulder as&nbsp; he listened attentively to some geological remarks Rob was making on a&nbsp; stone he held. Usually, Ted made fun of such tastes, and loved to lay&nbsp; boulders in the student<U+2019>s path, put brickbats under his pillow, gravel&nbsp; in his shoes, or send parcels of dirt by express to <U+2018>Prof. R. M. Bhaer<U+2019>.&nbsp; Lately, he had treated Rob<U+2019>s hobbies respectfully, and had begun to&nbsp; appreciate the good qualities of this quiet brother whom he had always&nbsp; loved but rather undervalued, till his courage under fire won Ted<U+2019>s&nbsp; admiration, and made it impossible to forget a fault, the consequences&nbsp; of which might have been so terrible. The leg was still lame, though&nbsp; doing well, and Ted was always offering an arm as support, gazing&nbsp; anxiously at his brother, and trying to guess his wants; for regret was&nbsp; still keen in Ted<U+2019>s soul, and Rob<U+2019>s forgiveness only made it deeper. A&nbsp; fortunate slip on the stairs gave Rob an excuse for limping, and no one&nbsp; but Nan and Ted saw the wound; so the secret was safe up to this time.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We are talking about you, my lads. Come in and tell us what good fairy&nbsp; has been at work while we were gone. Or is it because absence sharpens&nbsp; our eyes, that we find such pleasant changes when we come back?<U+2019> said&nbsp; Mrs Jo, patting the sofa on either side, while the Professor forgot his&nbsp; piles of letters to admire the pleasing prospect of his wife in a bower&nbsp; of arms, as the boys sat down beside her, smiling affectionately, but&nbsp; feeling a little guilty; for till now <U+2018>Mum<U+2019> and <U+2018>Vater<U+2019> knew every event&nbsp; in their boyish lives.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, it<U+2019>s only because Bobby and I have been alone so much; we are sort&nbsp; of twins. I stir him up a bit, and he steadies me a great deal. You and&nbsp; father do the same, you know. Nice plan. I like it<U+2019>; and Ted felt that&nbsp; he had settled the matter capitally.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mother won<U+2019>t thank you for comparing yourself to her, Ted. I<U+2019>m&nbsp; flattered at being like father in any way. I try to be,<U+2019> answered Rob,&nbsp; as they laughed at Ted<U+2019>s compliment.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I do thank him, for it<U+2019>s true; and if you, Robin, do half as much for&nbsp; your brother as Papa has for me, your life won<U+2019>t be a failure,<U+2019> said&nbsp; Mrs Jo heartily. <U+2018>I<U+2019>m very glad to see you helping one another. It<U+2019>s the&nbsp; right way, and we can<U+2019>t begin too soon to try to understand the needs,&nbsp; virtues, and failings of those nearest us. Love should not make us blind&nbsp; to faults, nor familiarity make us too ready to blame the shortcomings&nbsp; we see. So work away, my sonnies, and give us more surprises of this&nbsp; sort as often as you like.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The liebe Mutter has said all. I too am well pleased at the friendly&nbsp; brother-warmth I find. It is good for everyone; long may it last!<U+2019> and&nbsp; Professor Bhaer nodded at the boys, who looked gratified, but rather at&nbsp; a loss how to respond to these flattering remarks.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob wisely kept silent, fearing to say too much; but Ted burst out,&nbsp; finding it impossible to help telling something:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The fact is I<U+2019>ve been finding out what a brave good chap Bobby is, and&nbsp; I<U+2019>m trying to make up for all the bother I<U+2019>ve been to him. I knew he&nbsp; was awfully wise, but I thought him rather soft, because he liked books&nbsp; better than larks, and was always fussing about his conscience. But I&nbsp; begin to see that it isn<U+2019>t the fellows who talk the loudest and show&nbsp; off best that are the manliest. No, sir! quiet old Bob is a hero and a&nbsp; trump, and I<U+2019>m proud of him; so would you be if you knew all about it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Here a look from Rob brought Ted up with a round turn; he stopped short,&nbsp; grew red, and clapped his hand on his mouth in dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, are we not to <U+201C>know all about it<U+201D>?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo quickly; for her&nbsp; sharp eye saw signs of danger and her maternal heart felt that something&nbsp; had come between her and her sons. <U+2018>Boys,<U+2019> she went on solemnly, <U+2018>I&nbsp; suspect that the change we talk about is not altogether the effect of&nbsp; growing up, as we say. It strikes me that Ted has been in mischief and&nbsp; Rob has got him out of some scrape; hence the lovely mood of my bad boy&nbsp; and the sober one of my conscientious son, who never hides anything from&nbsp; his mother.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob was as red as Ted now, but after a moment<U+2019>s hesitation he looked up&nbsp; and answered with an air of relief:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, mother, that<U+2019>s it; but it<U+2019>s all over and no harm done, and I think&nbsp; we<U+2019>d better let it be, for a while at least. I did feel guilty to keep&nbsp; anything from you, but now you know so much I shall not worry and you&nbsp; needn<U+2019>t either. Ted<U+2019>s sorry, I don<U+2019>t mind, and it has done us both&nbsp; good.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo looked at Ted, who winked hard but bore the look like a man;&nbsp; then she turned to Rob, who smiled at her so cheerfully that she felt&nbsp; reassured; but something in his face struck her, and she saw what it was&nbsp; that made him seem older, graver, yet more lovable than ever. It was the&nbsp; look pain of mind, as well as body, brings, and the patience of a sweet&nbsp; submission to some inevitable trial. Like a flash she guessed that some&nbsp; danger had been near her boy, and the glances she had caught between the&nbsp; two lads and Nan confirmed her fears.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Rob, dear, you have been ill, hurt, or seriously troubled by Ted? Tell&nbsp; me at once; I will not have any secrets now. Boys sometimes suffer all&nbsp; their lives from neglected accidents or carelessness. Fritz, make them&nbsp; speak out!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr Bhaer put down his papers and came to stand before them, saying in a&nbsp; tone that quieted Mrs Jo, and gave the boys courage:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My sons, give us the truth. We can bear it; do not hold it back to&nbsp; spare us. Ted knows we forgive much because we love him, so be frank,&nbsp; all two.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ted instantly dived among the sofa pillows and kept there, with only a&nbsp; pair of scarlet ears visible, while Rob in a few words told the little&nbsp; story, truthfully, but as gently as he could, hastening to add the&nbsp; comfortable assurance that Don was not mad, the wound nearly well, and&nbsp; no danger would ever come of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; But Mrs Jo grew so pale he had to put his arms about her, and his father&nbsp; turned and walked away, exclaiming: <U+2018>Ach Himmel!<U+2019> in a tone of such&nbsp; mingled pain, relief, and gratitude, that Ted pulled an extra pillow&nbsp; over his head to smother the sound. They were all right in a minute;&nbsp; but such news is always a shock, even if the peril is past, and Mrs Jo&nbsp; hugged her boy close till his father came and took him away, saying with&nbsp; a strong shake of both hands and a quiver in his voice:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>To be in danger of one<U+2019>s life tries a man<U+2019>s mettle, and you bear it&nbsp; well; but I cannot spare my good boy yet; thank Gott, we keep him safe!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; A smothered sound, between a choke and a groan, came from under the&nbsp; pillows, and the writhing of Ted<U+2019>s long legs so plainly expressed&nbsp; despair that his mother relented towards him, and burrowing till she&nbsp; found a tousled yellow head, pulled it out and smoothed it, exclaiming&nbsp; with an irrepressible laugh, though her cheeks were wet with tears:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come and be forgiven, poor sinner! I know you have suffered enough, and&nbsp; I won<U+2019>t say a word; only if harm had come to Rob you would have made&nbsp; me more miserable than yourself. Oh, Teddy, Teddy, do try to cure that&nbsp; wilful spirit of yours before it is too late!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, Mum, I do try! I never can forget this--I hope it<U+2019>s cured me; if it&nbsp; hasn<U+2019>t, I am afraid I ain<U+2019>t worth saving,<U+2019> answered Ted, pulling his own&nbsp; hair as the only way of expressing his deep remorse.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, you are, my dear; I felt just so at fifteen when Amy was nearly&nbsp; drowned, and Marmee helped me as I<U+2019>ll help you. Come to me, Teddy, when&nbsp; the evil one gets hold of you, and together we<U+2019>ll rout him. Ah, me! I<U+2019>ve&nbsp; had many a tussle with that old Apollyon, and often got worsted, but not&nbsp; always. Come under my shield, and we<U+2019>ll fight till we win.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; No one spoke for a minute as Ted and his mother laughed and cried in&nbsp; one handkerchief, and Rob stood with his father<U+2019>s arm round him so happy&nbsp; that all was told and forgiven, though never to be forgotten; for&nbsp; such experiences do one good, and knit hearts that love more closely&nbsp; together.&nbsp; &nbsp; Presently Ted rose straight up and going to his father, said bravely and&nbsp; humbly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I ought to be punished. Please do it; but first say you forgive me, as&nbsp; Rob does.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Always that, mein Sohn, seventy time seven, if needs be, else I am&nbsp; not worthy the name you give me. The punishment has come; I can give no&nbsp; greater. Let it not be in vain. It will not with the help of the mother&nbsp; and the All Father. Room here for both, always!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The good Professor opened his arms and embraced his boys like a true&nbsp; German, not ashamed to express by gesture or by word the fatherly&nbsp; emotions an American would have compressed into a slap on the shoulder&nbsp; and a brief <U+2018>All right<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo sat and enjoyed the prospect like a romantic soul as she was, and&nbsp; then they had a quiet talk together, saying freely all that was in their&nbsp; hearts, and finding much comfort in the confidence which comes when love&nbsp; casts out fear. It was agreed that nothing be said except to Nan,&nbsp; who was to be thanked and rewarded for her courage, discretion, and&nbsp; fidelity.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I always knew that girl had the making of a fine woman in her, and this&nbsp; proves it. No panics and shrieks and faintings and fuss, but calm&nbsp; sense and energetic skill. Dear child, what can I give or do to show my&nbsp; gratitude?<U+2019> said Mrs Jo enthusiastically.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Make Tom clear out and leave her in peace,<U+2019> suggested Ted, almost&nbsp; himself again, though a pensive haze still partially obscured his native&nbsp; gaiety.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, do! he frets her like a mosquito. She forbade him to come out here&nbsp; while she stayed, and packed him off with Demi. I like old Tom, but he&nbsp; is a regular noodle about Nan,<U+2019> added Rob, as he went away to help his&nbsp; father with the accumulated letters.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll do it!<U+2019> said Mrs Jo decidedly. <U+2018>That girl<U+2019>s career shall not be&nbsp; hampered by a foolish boy<U+2019>s fancy. In a moment of weariness she may give&nbsp; in, and then it<U+2019>s all over. Wiser women have done so and regretted it&nbsp; all their lives. Nan shall earn her place first, and prove that she can&nbsp; fill it; then she may marry if she likes, and can find a man worthy of&nbsp; her.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; But Mrs Jo<U+2019>s help was not needed; for love and gratitude can work&nbsp; miracles, and when youth, beauty, accident, and photography are added,&nbsp; success is sure; as was proved in the case of the unsuspecting but too&nbsp; susceptible Thomas.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 8. JOSIE PLAYS MERMAID&nbsp; &nbsp; While the young Bhaers were having serious experiences at home, Josie&nbsp; was enjoying herself immensely at Rocky Nook; for the Laurences knew how&nbsp; to make summer idleness both charming and wholesome. Bess was very fond&nbsp; of her little cousin; Mrs Amy felt that whether her niece was an actress&nbsp; or not she must be a gentlewoman, and gave her the social training&nbsp; which marks the well-bred woman everywhere; while Uncle Laurie was never&nbsp; happier than when rowing, riding, playing, or lounging with two gay&nbsp; girls beside him. Josie bloomed like a wild flower in this free life,&nbsp; Bess grew rosy, brisk, and merry, and both were great favourites with&nbsp; the neighbours, whose villas were by the shore or perched on the cliffs&nbsp; along the pretty bay.&nbsp; &nbsp; One crumpled rose-leaf disturbed Josie<U+2019>s peace, one baffled wish filled&nbsp; her with a longing which became a mania, and kept her as restless and&nbsp; watchful as a detective with a case to <U+2018>work up<U+2019>. Miss Cameron, the&nbsp; great actress, had hired one of the villas and retired thither to rest&nbsp; and <U+2018>create<U+2019> a new part for next season. She saw no one but a friend&nbsp; or two, had a private beach, and was invisible except during her daily&nbsp; drive, or when the opera-glasses of curious gazers were fixed on a&nbsp; blue figure disporting itself in the sea. The Laurences knew her, but&nbsp; respected her privacy, and after a call left her in peace till she&nbsp; expressed a wish for society--a courtesy which she remembered and repaid&nbsp; later, as we shall see.&nbsp; &nbsp; But Josie was like a thirsty fly buzzing about a sealed honey-pot, for&nbsp; this nearness to her idol was both delightful and maddening. She pined&nbsp; to see, hear, talk with, and study this great and happy woman who could&nbsp; thrill thousands by her art, and win friends by her virtue, benevolence,&nbsp; and beauty. This was the sort of actress the girl meant to be, and few&nbsp; could object if the gift was really hers; for the stage needs just such&nbsp; women to purify and elevate the profession which should teach as well as&nbsp; amuse. If kindly Miss Cameron had known what passionate love and longing&nbsp; burned in the bosom of the little girl whom she idly observed skipping&nbsp; over the rocks, splashing about the beach, or galloping past her gate on&nbsp; a Shetland pony, she would have made her happy by a look or a word. But&nbsp; being tired with her winter<U+2019>s work and busy with her new part, the lady&nbsp; took no more notice of this young neighbour than of the sea-gulls in the&nbsp; bay or the daisies dancing in the fields. Nosegays left on her doorstep,&nbsp; serenades under her garden-wall, and the fixed stare of admiring eyes&nbsp; were such familiar things that she scarcely minded them; and Josie grew&nbsp; desperate when all her little attempts failed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I might climb that pine-tree and tumble off on her piazza roof, or get&nbsp; Sheltie to throw me just at her gate and be taken in fainting. It<U+2019>s no&nbsp; use to try to drown myself when she is bathing. I can<U+2019>t sink, and she<U+2019>d&nbsp; only send a man to pull me out. What can I do? I will see her and tell&nbsp; her my hopes and make her say I can act some day. Mamma would believe&nbsp; her; and if--oh, if she only would let me study with her, what perfect&nbsp; joy that would be!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie made these remarks one afternoon as she and Bess prepared for a&nbsp; swim, a fishing party having prevented their morning bathe.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You must bide your time, dear, and not be so impatient. Papa promised&nbsp; to give you a chance before the season is over, and he always manages&nbsp; things nicely. That will be better than any queer prank of yours,<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Bess, tying her pretty hair in a white net to match her suit,&nbsp; while Josie made a little lobster of herself in scarlet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I hate to wait; but I suppose I must. Hope she will bathe this&nbsp; afternoon, though it is low tide. She told Uncle she should have to go&nbsp; in then because in the morning people stared so and went on her beach.&nbsp; Come and have a good dive from the big rock. No one round but nurses and&nbsp; babies, so we can romp and splash as much as we like.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Away they went to have a fine time; for the little bay was free from&nbsp; other bathers, and the babies greatly admired their aquatic gymnastics,&nbsp; both being expert swimmers.&nbsp; &nbsp; As they sat dripping on the big rock Josie suddenly gave a clutch that&nbsp; nearly sent Bess overboard, as she cried excitedly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>There she is! Look! coming to bathe. How splendid! Oh, if she only&nbsp; would drown a little and let me save her! or even get her toe nipped by&nbsp; a crab; anything so I could go and speak!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t seem to look; she comes to be quiet and enjoy herself. Pretend&nbsp; we don<U+2019>t see her, that<U+2019>s only civil,<U+2019> answered Bess, affecting to be&nbsp; absorbed in a white-winged yacht going by.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let<U+2019>s carelessly float that way as if going for seaweed on the rocks.&nbsp; She can<U+2019>t mind if we are flat on our backs, with only our noses out.&nbsp; Then when we can<U+2019>t help seeing her, we<U+2019>ll swim back as if anxious to&nbsp; retire. That will impress her, and she may call to thank the very polite&nbsp; young ladies who respect her wishes,<U+2019> proposed Josie, whose lively fancy&nbsp; was always planning dramatic situations.&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as they were going to slip from their rock, as if Fate relented at&nbsp; last, Miss Cameron was seen to beckon wildly as she stood waist-deep in&nbsp; the water, looking down. She called to her maid, who seemed searching&nbsp; along the beach for something, and not finding what she sought, waved a&nbsp; towel towards the girls as if summoning them to help her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Run, fly! she wants us, she wants us!<U+2019> cried Josie, tumbling into the&nbsp; water like a very energetic turtle, and swimming away in her best style&nbsp; towards this long desired haven of joy. Bess followed more slowly, and&nbsp; both came panting and smiling up to Miss Cameron, who never lifted her&nbsp; eyes, but said in that wonderful voice of hers:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve dropped a bracelet. I see it, but can<U+2019>t get it. Will the little&nbsp; boy find me a long stick? I<U+2019>ll keep my eye on it, so the water shall not&nbsp; wash it away.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll dive for it with pleasure; but I<U+2019>m not a boy,<U+2019> answered Josie,&nbsp; laughing as she shook the curly head which at a distance had deceived&nbsp; the lady.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I beg your pardon. Dive away, child; the sand is covering it fast. I&nbsp; value it very much. Never forgot to take it off before.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll get it!<U+2019> and down went Josie, to come up with a handful of&nbsp; pebbles, but no bracelet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s gone; never mind--my fault,<U+2019> said Miss Cameron, disappointed, but&nbsp; amused at the girl<U+2019>s dismay as she shook the water out of her eyes and&nbsp; gasped bravely:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, it isn<U+2019>t. I<U+2019>ll have it, if I stay down all night!<U+2019> and with one&nbsp; long breath Josie dived again, leaving nothing but a pair of agitated&nbsp; feet to be seen.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m afraid she will hurt herself,<U+2019> said Miss Cameron, looking at Bess,&nbsp; whom she recognized by her likeness to her mother.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, no; Josie is a little fish. She likes it<U+2019>; and Bess smiled happily&nbsp; at this wonderful granting of her cousin<U+2019>s desire.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are Mr Laurence<U+2019>s daughter, I think? How d<U+2019>ye do, dear? Tell papa&nbsp; I<U+2019>m coming to see him soon. Too tired before. Quite savage. Better now.&nbsp; Ah! here<U+2019>s our pearl of divers. What luck?<U+2019> she asked, as the heels went&nbsp; down and a dripping head came up.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie could only choke and splutter at first, being half strangled;&nbsp; but though her hands had failed again, her courage had not; and with a&nbsp; resolute shake of her wet hair, a bright look at the tall lady, and a&nbsp; series of puffs to fill her lungs, she said calmly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018><U+201C>Never give up<U+201D> is my motto. I<U+2019>m going to get it, if I go to Liverpool&nbsp; for it! Now, then!<U+2019> and down went the mermaid quite out of sight this&nbsp; time, groping like a real lobster at the bottom of the sea.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Plucky little girl! I like that. Who is she?<U+2019> asked the lady, sitting&nbsp; down on a half-covered stone to watch her diver, since the bracelet was&nbsp; lost sight of.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bess told her, adding, with the persuasive smile of her father: <U+2018>Josie&nbsp; longs to be an actress, and has waited for a month to see you. This is a&nbsp; great happiness for her.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless the child! why didn<U+2019>t she come and call? I<U+2019>d have let her in;&nbsp; though usually I avoid stage-struck girls as I do reporters,<U+2019> laughed&nbsp; Miss Cameron.&nbsp; &nbsp; There was no time for more; a brown hand, grasping the bracelet, rose&nbsp; out of the sea, followed by a purple face as Josie came up so blind and&nbsp; dizzy she could only cling to Bess, half drowned but triumphant.&nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Cameron drew her to the rock where she sat, and pushing the hair&nbsp; out of her eyes, revived her with a hearty <U+2018>Bravo! bravo!<U+2019> which assured&nbsp; the girl that her first act was a hit. Josie had often imagined her&nbsp; meeting with the great actress--the dignity and grace with which she&nbsp; would enter and tell her ambitious hopes, the effective dress she would&nbsp; wear, the witty things she would say, the deep impression her budding&nbsp; genius would make. But never in her wildest moments had she imagined&nbsp; an interview like this; scarlet, sandy, streaming, and speechless she&nbsp; leaned against the illustrious shoulder, looking like a beautiful seal&nbsp; as she blinked and wheezed till she could smile joyfully and exclaim&nbsp; proudly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I did get it! I<U+2019>m so glad!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now get your breath, my dear; then I shall be glad also. It was very&nbsp; nice of you to take all that trouble for me. How shall I thank you?<U+2019>&nbsp; asked the lady, looking at her with the beautiful eyes that could say so&nbsp; many things without words.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie clasped her hands with a wet spat which rather destroyed the&nbsp; effect of the gesture, and answered in a beseeching tone that would have&nbsp; softened a far harder heart than Miss Cameron<U+2019>s:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let me come and see you once--only once! I want you to tell me if I&nbsp; can act; you will know. I<U+2019>ll abide by what you say; and if you think&nbsp; I can--by and by, when I<U+2019>ve studied very hard--I shall be the happiest&nbsp; girl in the world. May I?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes; come tomorrow at eleven. We<U+2019>ll have a good talk; you shall show me&nbsp; what you can do, and I<U+2019>ll give you my opinion. But you won<U+2019>t like it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will, no matter if you tell me I<U+2019>m a fool. I want it settled; so&nbsp; does mamma. I<U+2019>ll take it bravely if you say no; and if you say yes, I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; never give up till I<U+2019>ve done my best--as you did.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ah, my child, it<U+2019>s a weary road, and there are plenty of thorns among&nbsp; the roses when you<U+2019>ve won them. I think you have the courage, and this&nbsp; proves that you have perseverance. Perhaps you<U+2019>ll do. Come, and we<U+2019>ll&nbsp; see.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Cameron touched the bracelet as she spoke, and smiled so kindly&nbsp; that impetuous Josie wanted to kiss her; but wisely refrained, though&nbsp; her eyes were wet with softer water than any in the sea as she thanked&nbsp; her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We are keeping Miss Cameron from her bath, and the tide is going out.&nbsp; Come, Josie,<U+2019> said thoughtful Bess, fearing to outstay their welcome.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Run over the beach and get warm. Thank you very much, little mermaid.&nbsp; Tell papa to bring his daughter to see me any time. Good-bye<U+2019>; and with&nbsp; a wave of her hand the tragedy queen dismissed her court, but remained&nbsp; on her weedy throne watching the two lithe figures race over the sand&nbsp; with twinkling feet till they were out of sight. Then, as she calmly&nbsp; bobbed up and down in the water, she said to herself: <U+2018>The child has a&nbsp; good stage face, vivid, mobile; fine eyes, abandon, pluck, will. Perhaps&nbsp; she<U+2019>ll do. Good stock--talent in the family. We shall see.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course Josie never slept a wink, and was in a fever of joyful&nbsp; excitement next day. Uncle Laurie enjoyed the episode very much,&nbsp; and Aunt Amy looked out her most becoming white dress for the grand&nbsp; occasion; Bess lent her most artistic hat, and Josie ranged the wood&nbsp; and marsh for a bouquet of wild roses, sweet white azalea, ferns, and&nbsp; graceful grasses, as the offering of a very grateful heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; At ten she solemnly arrayed herself, and then sat looking at her neat&nbsp; gloves and buckled shoes till it was time to go, growing pale and sober&nbsp; with the thought that her fate was soon to be decided; for, like all&nbsp; young people she was sure that her whole life could be settled by one&nbsp; human creature, quite forgetting how wonderfully Providence trains us&nbsp; by disappointment, surprises us with unexpected success, and turns our&nbsp; seeming trials into blessings.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will go alone: we shall be freer so. Oh, Bess, pray that she may tell&nbsp; me rightly! So much depends on that! Don<U+2019>t laugh, uncle! It is a very&nbsp; serious moment for me. Miss Cameron knows that, and will tell you so.&nbsp; Kiss me, Aunt Amy, since mamma isn<U+2019>t here. If you say I look nice, I<U+2019>m&nbsp; quite satisfied. Good-bye.<U+2019> And with a wave of the hand as much like her&nbsp; model<U+2019>s as she could make it, Josie departed, looking very pretty and&nbsp; feeling very tragical.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sure now of admittance, she boldly rang at the door which excluded so&nbsp; many, and being ushered into a shady parlour, feasted her eyes upon&nbsp; several fine portraits of great actors while she waited. She had read&nbsp; about most of them, and knew their trials and triumphs so well that she&nbsp; soon forgot herself, and tried to imitate Mrs Siddons as Lady Macbeth,&nbsp; looking up at the engraving as she held her nosegay like the candle in&nbsp; the sleep-walking scene, and knit her youthful brows distressfully while&nbsp; murmuring the speech of the haunted queen. So busy was she that Miss&nbsp; Cameron watched her for several minutes unseen, then startled her by&nbsp; suddenly sweeping in with the words upon her lips, the look upon her&nbsp; face, which made that one of her greatest scenes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I never can do it like that; but I<U+2019>ll keep trying, if you say I may,<U+2019>&nbsp; cried Josie, forgetting her manners in the intense interest of the&nbsp; moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Show me what you can do,<U+2019> answered the actress, wisely plunging into&nbsp; the middle of things at once, well knowing that no common chat would&nbsp; satisfy this very earnest little person.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>First let me give you these. I thought you<U+2019>d like wild things better&nbsp; than hot-house flowers; and I loved to bring them, as I<U+2019>d no other way&nbsp; to thank you for your great kindness to me,<U+2019> said Josie, offering her&nbsp; nosegay with a simple warmth that was very sweet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I do love them best, and keep my room full of the posies some good&nbsp; fairy hangs on my gate. Upon my word, I think I<U+2019>ve found the fairy&nbsp; out--these are so like,<U+2019> she added quickly, as her eye went from the&nbsp; flowers in her hand to others that stood near by, arranged with the same&nbsp; taste.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie<U+2019>s blush and smile betrayed her before she said, with a look full&nbsp; of girlish adoration and humility: <U+2018>I couldn<U+2019>t help it; I admire you so&nbsp; much. I know it was a liberty; but as I couldn<U+2019>t get in myself, I loved&nbsp; to think my posies pleased you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Something about the child and her little offering touched the woman,&nbsp; and, drawing Josie to her, she said, with no trace of actress in face or&nbsp; voice:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They did please me, dear, and so do you. I<U+2019>m tired of praise; and love&nbsp; is very sweet, when it is simple and sincere like this.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie remembered to have heard, among many other stories, that Miss&nbsp; Cameron lost her lover years ago, and since had lived only for art.&nbsp; Now she felt that this might have been true; and pity for the splendid,&nbsp; lonely life made her face very eloquent, as well as grateful. Then, as&nbsp; if anxious to forget the past, her new friend said, in the commanding&nbsp; way that seemed natural to her:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let me see what you can do. Juliet, of course. All begin with that.&nbsp; Poor soul, how she is murdered!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, Josie had intended to begin with Romeo<U+2019>s much-enduring sweetheart,&nbsp; and follow her up with Bianca, Pauline, and several of the favourite&nbsp; idols of stage-struck girls; but being a shrewd little person, she&nbsp; suddenly saw the wisdom of Uncle Laurie<U+2019>s advice, and resolved to&nbsp; follow it. So instead of the rant Miss Cameron expected, Josie gave poor&nbsp; Ophelia<U+2019>s mad scene, and gave it very well, having been trained by&nbsp; the college professor of elocution and done it many times. She was too&nbsp; young, of course, but the white gown, the loose hair, the real flowers&nbsp; she scattered over the imaginary grave, added to the illusion; and she&nbsp; sung the songs sweetly, dropped her pathetic curtsies, and vanished&nbsp; behind the curtain that divided the rooms with a backward look that&nbsp; surprised her critical auditor into a quick gesture of applause. Cheered&nbsp; by that welcome sound, Josie ran back as a little hoyden in one of the&nbsp; farces she had often acted, telling a story full of fun and naughtiness&nbsp; at first, but ending with a sob of repentance and an earnest prayer for&nbsp; pardon.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very good! Try again. Better than I expected,<U+2019> called the voice of the&nbsp; oracle.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie tried Portia<U+2019>s speech, and recited very well, giving due emphasis&nbsp; to each fine sentence. Then, unable to refrain from what she considered&nbsp; her greatest effort, she burst into Juliet<U+2019>s balcony scene, ending with&nbsp; the poison and the tomb. She felt sure that she surpassed herself, and&nbsp; waited for applause. A ringing laugh made her tingle with indignation&nbsp; and disappointment, as she went to stand before Miss Cameron, saying in&nbsp; a tone of polite surprise:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have been told that I did it very well. I<U+2019>m sorry you don<U+2019>t think&nbsp; so.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My dear, it<U+2019>s very bad. How can it help being so? What can a child like&nbsp; you know of love and fear and death? Don<U+2019>t try it yet. Leave tragedy&nbsp; alone till you are ready for it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But you clapped Ophelia.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, that was very pretty. Any clever girl can do it effectively. But&nbsp; the real meaning of Shakespeare is far above you yet, child. The comedy&nbsp; bit was best. There you showed real talent. It was both comic and&nbsp; pathetic. That<U+2019>s art. Don<U+2019>t lose it. The Portia was good declamation.&nbsp; Go on with that sort of thing; it trains the voice--teaches shades of&nbsp; expression. You<U+2019>ve a good voice and natural grace--great helps both,&nbsp; hard to acquire.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, I<U+2019>m glad I<U+2019>ve got something,<U+2019> sighed Josie, sitting meekly on a&nbsp; stool, much crestfallen, but not daunted yet, and bound to have her say&nbsp; out.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My dear little girl, I told you that you would not like what I should&nbsp; say to you; yet I must be honest if I would really help you. I<U+2019>ve had to&nbsp; do it for many like you; and most of them have never forgiven me, though&nbsp; my words have proved true, and they are what I advised them to be--good&nbsp; wives and happy mothers in quiet homes. A few have kept on, and done&nbsp; fairly well. One you will hear of soon, I think; for she has talent,&nbsp; indomitable patience, and mind as well as beauty. You are too young&nbsp; to show to which class you belong. Geniuses are very rare, and even at&nbsp; fifteen seldom give much promise of future power.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, I don<U+2019>t think I<U+2019>m a genius!<U+2019> cried Josie, growing calm and sober as&nbsp; she listened to the melodious voice and looked into the expressive face&nbsp; that filled her with confidence, so strong, sincere, and kindly was it.&nbsp; <U+2018>I only want to find out if I have talent enough to go on, and after&nbsp; years of study to be able to act well in any of the good plays people&nbsp; never tire of seeing. I don<U+2019>t expect to be a Mrs Siddons or a Miss&nbsp; Cameron, much as I long to be; but it does seem as if I had something&nbsp; in me which can<U+2019>t come out in any way but this. When I act I<U+2019>m perfectly&nbsp; happy. I seem to live, to be in my own world, and each new part is a new&nbsp; friend. I love Shakespeare, and am never tired of his splendid people.&nbsp; Of course, I don<U+2019>t understand it all; but it<U+2019>s like being alone at night&nbsp; with the mountains and the stars, solemn and grand, and I try to imagine&nbsp; how it will look when the sun comes up, and all is glorious and clear to&nbsp; me. I can<U+2019>t see, but I feel the beauty, and long to express it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As she spoke with the most perfect self-forgetfulness Josie was pale&nbsp; with excitement, her eyes shone, her lips trembled, and all her little&nbsp; soul seemed trying to put into words the emotions that filled it to&nbsp; overflowing. Miss Cameron understood, felt that this was something&nbsp; more than a girlish whim; and when she answered there was a new tone&nbsp; of sympathy in her voice, a new interest in her face, though she wisely&nbsp; refrained from saying all she thought, well knowing what splendid dreams&nbsp; young people build upon a word, and how bitter is the pain when the&nbsp; bright bubbles burst.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If you feel this, I can give you no better advice than to go on loving&nbsp; and studying our great master,<U+2019> she said slowly; but Josie caught the&nbsp; changed tone, and felt, with a thrill of joy, that her new friend was&nbsp; speaking to her now as to a comrade. <U+2018>It is an education in itself, and&nbsp; a lifetime is not long enough to teach you all his secret. But there is&nbsp; much to do before you can hope to echo his words. Have you the patience,&nbsp; courage, strength, to begin at the beginning, and slowly, painfully, lay&nbsp; the foundation for future work? Fame is a pearl many dive for and only&nbsp; a few bring up. Even when they do, it is not perfect, and they sigh for&nbsp; more, and lose better things in struggling for them.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The last words seemed spoken more to herself than to her hearer, but&nbsp; Josie answered quickly, with a smile and an expressive gesture:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I got the bracelet in spite of all the bitter water in my eyes.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You did! I don<U+2019>t forget it. A good omen. We will accept it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Cameron answered the smile with one that was like sunshine to the&nbsp; girl, and stretched her white hands as if taking some invisible gift.&nbsp; Then added in a different tone, watching the effect of her words on the&nbsp; expressive face before her:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now you will be disappointed, for instead of telling you to come and&nbsp; study with me, or go and act in some second-rate theatre at once, I&nbsp; advise you to go back to school and finish your education. That is the&nbsp; first step, for all accomplishments are needed, and a single talent&nbsp; makes a very imperfect character. Cultivate mind and body, heart and&nbsp; soul, and make yourself an intelligent, graceful, beautiful, and healthy&nbsp; girl. Then, at eighteen or twenty, go into training and try your powers.&nbsp; Better start for the battle with your arms in order, and save the hard&nbsp; lesson which comes when we rush on too soon. Now and then genius carries&nbsp; all before it, but not often. We have to climb slowly, with many slips&nbsp; and falls. Can you wait as well as work?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We shall see. It would be pleasant to me to know that when I quit the&nbsp; stage I leave behind me a well-trained, faithful, gifted comrade to&nbsp; more than fill my place, and carry on what I have much at heart--the&nbsp; purification of the stage. Perhaps you are she; but remember, mere&nbsp; beauty and rich costumes do not make an actress, nor are the efforts of&nbsp; a clever little girl to play great characters real art. It is all dazzle&nbsp; and sham, and a disgrace and disappointment now. Why will the public be&nbsp; satisfied with opera bouffe, or the trash called society plays when&nbsp; a world of truth and beauty, poetry and pathos lies waiting to be&nbsp; interpreted and enjoyed?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Cameron had forgotten to whom she spoke, and walked to and fro,&nbsp; full of the noble regret all cultivated people feel at the low state of&nbsp; the stage nowadays.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s what Uncle Laurie says; and he and Aunt Jo try to plan plays&nbsp; about true and lovely things--simple domestic scenes that touch people<U+2019>s&nbsp; hearts, and make them laugh and cry and feel better. Uncle says that&nbsp; sort is my style, and I must not think of tragedy. But it<U+2019>s so much&nbsp; nicer to sweep about in crowns and velvet trains than to wear everyday&nbsp; clothes, and just be myself, though it is so easy.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yet that is high art, child, and what we need for a time till we are&nbsp; ready for the masters. Cultivate that talent of yours. It is a special&nbsp; gift, this power to bring tears and smiles, and a sweeter task to touch&nbsp; the heart than to freeze the blood or fire the imagination. Tell your&nbsp; uncle he is right, and ask your aunt to try a play for you. I<U+2019>ll come&nbsp; and see it when you are ready.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Will you? Oh! will you? We are going to have some at Christmas, with a&nbsp; nice part for me. A simple little thing, but I can do it, and should be&nbsp; so proud, so happy to have you there.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie rose as she spoke, for a glance at the clock showed her that her&nbsp; call was a long one; and hard as it was to end this momentous interview,&nbsp; she felt that she must go. Catching up her hat she went to Miss Cameron,&nbsp; who stood looking at her so keenly that she felt as transparent as a&nbsp; pane of glass, and coloured prettily as she looked up, saying, with a&nbsp; grateful little tremor in her voice:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I can never thank you for this hour and all you have told me. I shall&nbsp; do just what you advise, and mamma will be very glad to see me settled&nbsp; at my books again. I can study now with all my heart, because it is to&nbsp; help me on; and I won<U+2019>t hope too much, but work and wait, and try to&nbsp; please you, as the only way to pay my debt.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That reminds me that I have not paid mine. Little friend, wear this&nbsp; for my sake. It is fit for a mermaid, and will remind you of your first&nbsp; dive. May the next bring up a better jewel, and leave no bitter water on&nbsp; your lips!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As she spoke, Miss Cameron took from the lace at her throat a pretty&nbsp; pin of aquamarine, and fastened it like an order on Josie<U+2019>s proud bosom;&nbsp; then lifting the happy little face, she kissed it very tenderly, and&nbsp; watched it go smiling away with eyes that seemed to see into a future&nbsp; full of the trials and the triumphs which she knew so well.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bess expected to see Josie come flying in, all raptures and excitement,&nbsp; or drowned in tears of disappointment, but was surprised at the&nbsp; expression of calm content and resolution which she wore. Pride and&nbsp; satisfaction, and a new feeling of responsibility both sobered and&nbsp; sustained her, and she felt that any amount of dry study and long&nbsp; waiting would be bearable, if in the glorious future she could be&nbsp; an honour to her profession and a comrade to the new friend whom she&nbsp; already adored with girlish ardour.&nbsp; &nbsp; She told her little story to a deeply interested audience, and all&nbsp; felt that Miss Cameron<U+2019>s advice was good. Mrs Amy was relieved at the&nbsp; prospect of delay; for she did not want her niece to be an actress and&nbsp; hoped the fancy would die out.&nbsp; &nbsp; Uncle Laurie was full of charming plans and prophecies and wrote one&nbsp; of his most delightful notes to thank their neighbour for her kindness;&nbsp; while Bess, who loved art of all kinds, fully sympathized with her&nbsp; cousin<U+2019>s ambitious hopes, only wondering why she preferred to act out&nbsp; her visions rather than embody them in marble.&nbsp; &nbsp; That first interview was not the last; for Miss Cameron was really&nbsp; interested, and had several memorable conversations with the Laurences,&nbsp; while the girls sat by, drinking in every word with the delight all&nbsp; artists feel in their own beautiful world, and learning to see how&nbsp; sacred good gifts are, how powerful, and how faithfully they should be&nbsp; used for high ends, each in its own place helping to educate, refine,&nbsp; and refresh.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie wrote reams to her mother; and when the visit ended rejoiced her&nbsp; heart by bringing her a somewhat changed little daughter, who fell to&nbsp; work at the once-detested books with a patient energy which surprised&nbsp; and pleased everyone. The right string had been touched, and even French&nbsp; exercises and piano practice became endurable, since accomplishments&nbsp; would be useful by and by; dress, manners, and habits were all&nbsp; interesting now, because <U+2018>mind and body, heart and soul, must be&nbsp; cultivated<U+2019>, and while training to become an <U+2018>intelligent, graceful,&nbsp; healthy girl<U+2019>, little Josie was unconsciously fitting herself to play&nbsp; her part well on whatever stage the great Manager might prepare for her.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 9. THE WORM TURNS&nbsp; &nbsp; Two very superior bicycles went twinkling up the road to Plumfield&nbsp; one September afternoon, bearing two brown and dusty riders evidently&nbsp; returning from a successful run, for though their legs might be a trifle&nbsp; weary, their faces beamed as they surveyed the world from their lofty&nbsp; perches with the air of calm content all wheelmen wear after they have&nbsp; learned to ride; before that happy period anguish of mind and body is&nbsp; the chief expression of the manly countenance.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Go ahead and report, Tom; I<U+2019>m due here. See you later,<U+2019> said Demi,&nbsp; swinging himself down at the door of the Dovecote.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t peach, there<U+2019>s a good fellow. Let me have it out with Mother&nbsp; Bhaer first,<U+2019> returned Tom, wheeling in at the gate with a heavy sigh.&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi laughed, and his comrade went slowly up the avenue, devoutly hoping&nbsp; that the coast was clear; for he was the bearer of tidings which would,&nbsp; he thought, convulse the entire family with astonishment and dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; To his great joy Mrs Jo was discovered alone in a grove of proof-sheets,&nbsp; which she dropped, to greet the returning wanderer cordially. But after&nbsp; the first glance she saw that something was the matter, recent events&nbsp; having made her unusually sharp-eyed and suspicious.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What is it now, Tom?<U+2019> she asked, as he subsided into an easy-chair with&nbsp; a curious expression of mingled fear, shame, amusement, and distress in&nbsp; his brick-red countenance.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m in an awful scrape, ma<U+2019>am.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Of course; I<U+2019>m always prepared for scrapes when you appear. What is&nbsp; it? Run over some old lady who is going to law about it?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo&nbsp; cheerfully.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Worse than that,<U+2019> groaned Tom.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not poisoned some trusting soul who asked you to prescribe, I hope?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Worse than that.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You haven<U+2019>t let Demi catch any horrid thing and left him behind, have&nbsp; you?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Worse even than that.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I give it up. Tell me quick; I hate to wait for bad news.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Having got his listener sufficiently excited, Tom launched his&nbsp; thunderbolt in one brief sentence, and fell back to watch the effect.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m engaged!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo<U+2019>s proof-sheets flew wildly about as she clasped her hands,&nbsp; exclaiming in dismay:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If Nan has yielded, I<U+2019>ll never forgive her!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She hasn<U+2019>t; it<U+2019>s another girl.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom<U+2019>s face was so funny as he said the words, that it was impossible&nbsp; to help laughing; for he looked both sheepish and pleased, besides very&nbsp; much perplexed and worried.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad, very glad indeed! Don<U+2019>t care who it is; and I hope you<U+2019>ll&nbsp; be married soon. Now tell me all about it,<U+2019> commanded Mrs Jo, so much&nbsp; relieved that she felt ready for anything.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What will Nan say?<U+2019> demanded Tom, rather taken aback at this view of&nbsp; his predicament.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She will be rejoiced to get rid of the mosquito who has plagued her so&nbsp; long. Don<U+2019>t worry about Nan. Who is this <U+201C>other girl<U+201D>?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Demi hasn<U+2019>t written about her?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Only something about your upsetting a Miss West down at Quitno; I&nbsp; thought that was scrape enough.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That was only the beginning of a series of scrapes. Just my luck! Of&nbsp; course after sousing the poor girl I had to be attentive to her, hadn<U+2019>t&nbsp; I? Everyone seemed to think so, and I couldn<U+2019>t get away, and so I was&nbsp; lost before I knew it. It<U+2019>s all Demi<U+2019>s fault, he would stay there and&nbsp; fuss with his old photos, because the views were good and all the girls&nbsp; wanted to be taken. Look at these, will you, ma<U+2019>am? That<U+2019>s the way we&nbsp; spent our time when we weren<U+2019>t playing tennis<U+2019>; and Tom pulled a&nbsp; handful of pictures from his pocket, displaying several in which he was&nbsp; conspicuous, either holding a sun-umbrella over a very pretty young lady&nbsp; on the rocks, reposing at her feet in the grass, or perched on a piazza&nbsp; railing with other couples in seaside costumes and effective attitudes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This is she of course?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, pointing to the much-ruffled&nbsp; damsel with the jaunty hat, coquettish shoes, and racquet in her hand.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s Dora. Isn<U+2019>t she lovely?<U+2019> cried Tom, forgetting his tribulations&nbsp; for a moment and speaking with lover-like ardour.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very nice little person to look at. Hope she is not a Dickens Dora?&nbsp; That curly crop looks like it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not a bit; she<U+2019>s very smart; can keep house, and sew, and do lots&nbsp; of things, I assure you, ma<U+2019>am. All the girls like her, and she<U+2019>s&nbsp; sweet-tempered and jolly, and sings like a bird, and dances beautifully,&nbsp; and loves books. Thinks yours are splendid, and made me talk about you&nbsp; no end.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That last sentence is to flatter me and win my help to get you out of&nbsp; the scrape. Tell me first how you got in<U+2019>; and Mrs Jo settled herself to&nbsp; listen with interest, never tired of boys<U+2019> affairs.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom gave his head a rousing rub all over to clear his wits, and plunged&nbsp; into his story with a will.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, we<U+2019>ve met her before, but I didn<U+2019>t know she was there. Demi&nbsp; wanted to see a fellow, so we went, and finding it nice and cool rested&nbsp; over Sunday. Found some pleasant people and went out rowing; I had Dora,&nbsp; and came to grief on a confounded rock. She could swim, no harm done,&nbsp; only the scare and the spoilt gown. She took it well, and we got&nbsp; friendly at once--couldn<U+2019>t help it, scrambling into that beast of a boat&nbsp; while the rest laughed at us. Of course we had to stay another day to&nbsp; see that Dora was all right. Demi wanted to. Alice Heath is down there&nbsp; and two other girls from our college, so we sort of lingered along,&nbsp; and Demi kept taking pictures, and we danced, and got into a tennis&nbsp; tournament; and that was as good exercise as wheeling, we thought. Fact&nbsp; is, tennis is a dangerous game, ma<U+2019>am. A great deal of courting goes&nbsp; on in those courts, and we fellows find that sort of <U+201C>serving<U+201D> mighty&nbsp; agreeable, don<U+2019>t you know?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not much tennis in my day, but I understand perfectly,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo,&nbsp; enjoying it all as much as Tom did.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Upon my word, I hadn<U+2019>t the least idea of being serious,<U+2019> he continued&nbsp; slowly, as if this part of his tale was hard to tell; <U+2018>but everyone else&nbsp; spooned, so I did. Dora seemed to like it and expect it, and of course&nbsp; I was glad to be agreeable. She thought I amounted to something, though&nbsp; Nan does not, and it was pleasant to be appreciated after years of&nbsp; snubbing. Yes, it was right down jolly to have a sweet girl smile at you&nbsp; all day, and blush prettily when you said a neat thing to her, and look&nbsp; glad when you came, sorry when you left, and admire all you did, and&nbsp; make you feel like a man and act your best. That<U+2019>s the sort of treatment&nbsp; a fellow enjoys and ought to get if he behaves himself; not frowns and&nbsp; cold shoulders year in and year out, and made to look like a fool when&nbsp; he means well, and is faithful, and has loved a girl ever since he was a&nbsp; boy. No, by Jove, it<U+2019>s not fair, and I won<U+2019>t stand it!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom waxed warm and eloquent as he thought over his wrongs, and bounced&nbsp; up to march about the room, wagging his head and trying to feel&nbsp; aggrieved as usual, but surprised to find that his heart did not ache a&nbsp; bit.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I wouldn<U+2019>t. Drop the old fancy, for it was nothing more, and take up&nbsp; the new one, if it is genuine. But how came you to propose, Tom, as you&nbsp; must have done to be engaged?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, impatient for the crisis of&nbsp; the tale.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, that was an accident. I didn<U+2019>t mean it at all; the donkey did it,&nbsp; and I couldn<U+2019>t get out of the scrape without hurting Dora<U+2019>s feelings,&nbsp; you see,<U+2019> began Tom, seeing that the fatal moment had come.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So there were two donkeys in it, were there?<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, foreseeing&nbsp; fun of some sort.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t laugh! It sounds funny, I know; but it might have been awful,<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Tom darkly, though a twinkle of the eye showed that his love&nbsp; trials did not quite blind him to the comic side of the adventure.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The girls admired our new wheels, and of course we liked to show off.&nbsp; Took <U+2018>em to ride, and had larks generally. Well, one day, Dora was&nbsp; on behind, and we were going nicely along a good bit of road, when a&nbsp; ridiculous old donkey got right across the way. I thought he<U+2019>d move, but&nbsp; he didn<U+2019>t, so I gave him a kick; he kicked back, and over we went in a&nbsp; heap, donkey and all. Such a mess! I thought only of Dora, and she had&nbsp; hysterics; at least, she laughed till she cried, and that beast brayed,&nbsp; and I lost my head. Any fellow would, with a poor girl gasping in the&nbsp; road, and he wiping her tears and begging pardon, not knowing whether&nbsp; her bones were broken or not. I called her my darling, and went on like&nbsp; a fool in my flurry, till she grew calmer, and said, with such a look:&nbsp; <U+201C>I forgive you, Tom. Pick me up, and let us go on again.<U+201D>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Wasn<U+2019>t that sweet now, after I<U+2019>d upset her for the second time? It&nbsp; touched me to the heart; and I said I<U+2019>d like to go on for ever with such&nbsp; an angel to steer for, and--well I don<U+2019>t know what I did say; but you&nbsp; might have knocked me down with a feather when she put her arm round my&nbsp; neck and whispered: <U+201C>Tom, dear, with you I<U+2019>m not afraid of any lions in&nbsp; the path.<U+201D> She might have said donkeys; but she was in earnest, and she&nbsp; spared my feelings. Very nice of the dear girl; but there I am with two&nbsp; sweethearts on my hands, and in a deuce of a scrape.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Finding it impossible to contain herself another moment, Mrs Jo laughed&nbsp; till the tears ran down her cheeks at this characteristic episode; and&nbsp; after one reproachful look, which only added to her merriment, Tom burst&nbsp; into a jolly roar that made the room ring.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Tommy Bangs! Tommy Bangs! who but you could ever get into such a&nbsp; catastrophe?<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, when she recovered her breath.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Isn<U+2019>t it a muddle all round, and won<U+2019>t everyone chaff me to death about&nbsp; it? I shall have to quit old Plum for a while,<U+2019> answered Tom, as he&nbsp; mopped his face, trying to realize the full danger of his position.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, indeed; I<U+2019>ll stand by you, for I think it the best joke of the&nbsp; season. But tell me how things ended. Is it really serious, or only a&nbsp; summer flirtation? I don<U+2019>t approve of them, but boys and girls will play&nbsp; with edged tools and cut their fingers.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, Dora considers herself engaged, and wrote to her people at once.&nbsp; I couldn<U+2019>t say a word when she took it all in solemn earnest and seemed&nbsp; so happy. She<U+2019>s only seventeen, never liked anyone before, and is sure&nbsp; all will be all right; as her father knows mine, and we are both well&nbsp; off. I was so staggered that I said:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018><U+201C>Why, you can<U+2019>t love me really when we know so little of one another?<U+201D>&nbsp;  But she answered right out of her tender little heart: <U+201C>Yes, I do,&nbsp; dearly, Tom; you are so gay and kind and honest, I couldn<U+2019>t help it.<U+201D>&nbsp;  Now, after that what could I do but go ahead and make her happy while I&nbsp; stayed, and trust to luck to straighten the snarl out afterwards?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A truly Tomian way of taking things easy. I hope you told your father&nbsp; at once.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh yes, I wrote off and broke it to him in three lines. I said: <U+201C>Dear&nbsp; Father, I<U+2019>m engaged to Dora West, and I hope she will suit the family.&nbsp; She suits me tip-top. Yours ever, Tom.<U+201D> He was all right, never liked&nbsp; Nan, you know; but Dora will suit him down to the ground.<U+2019> And Tom&nbsp; looked entirely satisfied with his own tact and taste.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What did Demi say to this rapid and funny lovemaking? Wasn<U+2019>t he&nbsp; scandalized?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, trying not to laugh again as she thought of&nbsp; the unromantic spectacle of donkey, bicycle, boy, and girl all in the&nbsp; dust together.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not a bit. He was immensely interested and very kind; talked to me like&nbsp; a father; said it was a good thing to steady a fellow, only I must be&nbsp; honest with her and myself and not trifle a moment. Demi is a regular&nbsp; Solomon, especially when he is in the same boat,<U+2019> answered Tom, looking&nbsp; wise.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You don<U+2019>t mean--?<U+2019> gasped Mrs Jo, in sudden alarm at the bare idea of&nbsp; more love-affairs just yet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, I do, please, ma<U+2019>am; it<U+2019>s a regular sell all the way through, and&nbsp; I owe Demi one for taking me into temptation blindfold. He said he went&nbsp; to Quitno to see Fred Wallace, but he never saw the fellow. How could&nbsp; he, when Wallace was off in his yacht all the time we were there? Alice&nbsp; was the real attraction, and I was left to my fate, while they were&nbsp; maundering round with that old camera. There were three donkeys in&nbsp; this affair, and I<U+2019>m not the worst one, though I shall have to bear the&nbsp; laugh. Demi will look innocent and sober, and no one will say a word to&nbsp; him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The midsummer madness has broken out, and no one knows who will be&nbsp; stricken next. Well, leave Demi to his mother, and let us see what you&nbsp; are going to do, Tom.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t know exactly; it<U+2019>s awkward to be in love with two girls at&nbsp; once. What do you advise?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A common-sense view of the case, by all means. Dora loves you and&nbsp; thinks you love her. Nan does not care for you, and you only care for&nbsp; her as a friend, though you have tried to do more. It is my opinion,&nbsp; Tom, that you love Dora, or are on the way to it; for in all these&nbsp; years I<U+2019>ve never seen you look or speak about Nan as you do about Dora.&nbsp; Opposition has made you obstinately cling to her till accident has shown&nbsp; you a more attractive girl. Now, I think you had better take the old&nbsp; love for a friend, the new one for a sweetheart, and in due time, if the&nbsp; sentiment is genuine, marry her.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; If Mrs Jo had any doubts about the matter, Tom<U+2019>s face would have proved&nbsp; the truth of her opinion; for his eyes shone, his lips smiled, and in&nbsp; spite of dust and sunburn a new expression of happiness quite glorified&nbsp; him as he stood silent for a moment, trying to understand the beautiful&nbsp; miracle which real love works when it comes to a young man<U+2019>s heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The fact is I meant to make Nan jealous, for she knows Dora, and I was&nbsp; sure would hear of our doings. I was tired of being walked on, and I&nbsp; thought I<U+2019>d try to break away and not be a bore and a laughing-stock any&nbsp; more,<U+2019> he said slowly, as if it relieved him to pour out his doubts and&nbsp; woes and hopes and joys to his old friend. <U+2018>I was regularly astonished&nbsp; to find it so easy and so pleasant. I didn<U+2019>t mean to do any harm,&nbsp; but drifted along beautifully, and told Demi to mention things in his&nbsp; letters to Daisy, so Nan might know. Then I forgot Nan altogether, and&nbsp; saw, heard, felt, cared for no one but Dora, till the donkey--bless his&nbsp; old heart!--pitched her into my arms and I found she loved me. Upon my&nbsp; soul, I don<U+2019>t see why she should! I<U+2019>m not half good enough.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Every honest man feels that when an innocent girl puts her hand in his.&nbsp; Make yourself worthy of her, for she isn<U+2019>t an angel, but a woman with&nbsp; faults of her own for you to bear, and forgive, and you must help one&nbsp; another,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, trying to realize that this sober youth was her&nbsp; scapegrace Tommy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What troubles me is that I didn<U+2019>t mean it when I began, and was going&nbsp; to use the dear girl as an instrument of torture for Nan. It wasn<U+2019>t&nbsp; right, and I don<U+2019>t deserve to be so happy. If all my scrapes ended as&nbsp; well as this, what a state of bliss I should be in!<U+2019> and Tom beamed&nbsp; again at the rapturous prospect.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My dear boy, it is not a scrape, but a very sweet experience suddenly&nbsp; dawning upon you,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, speaking very soberly; for she saw&nbsp; he was in earnest. <U+2018>Enjoy it wisely and be worthy of it, for it is a&nbsp; serious thing to accept a girl<U+2019>s love and trust, and let her look up to&nbsp; you for tenderness and truth in return. Don<U+2019>t let little Dora look in&nbsp; vain, but be a man in all things for her sake, and make this affection a&nbsp; blessing to you both.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll try. Yes, I do love her, only I can<U+2019>t believe it just yet. Wish&nbsp; you knew her. Dear little soul, I long to see her already! She cried&nbsp; when we parted last night and I hated to go.<U+2019> Tom<U+2019>s hand went to his&nbsp; cheek as if he still felt the rosy little seal Dora had set upon his&nbsp; promise not to forget her, and for the first time in his happy-go-lucky&nbsp; life Tommy Bangs understood the difference between sentiment and&nbsp; sentimentality. The feeling recalled Nan, for he had never known that&nbsp; tender thrill when thinking of her, and the old friendship seemed rather&nbsp; a prosaic affair beside this delightful mingling of romance, surprise,&nbsp; love, and fun. <U+2018>I declare, I feel as if a weight was off me, but&nbsp; what the dickens will Nan say when she knows it!<U+2019> he exclaimed with a&nbsp; chuckle.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Knows what?<U+2019> asked a clear voice that made both start and turn, for&nbsp; there was Nan calmly surveying them from the doorway.&nbsp; &nbsp; Anxious to put Tom out of suspense and see how Nan would take the news,&nbsp; Mrs Jo answered quickly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Tom<U+2019>s engagement to Dora West.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Really?<U+2019> and Nan looked so surprised that Mrs Jo was afraid she might&nbsp; be fonder of her old playmate than she knew; but her next words set the&nbsp; fear at rest, and made everything comfortable and merry at once.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I knew my prescription would work wonders if he only took it long&nbsp; enough. Dear old Tom, I<U+2019>m so glad. Bless you! bless you!<U+2019> And she shook&nbsp; both his hands with hearty affection.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It was an accident, Nan. I didn<U+2019>t mean to, but I<U+2019>m always getting into&nbsp; messes, and I couldn<U+2019>t seem to get out of this any other way. Mother&nbsp; Bhaer will tell you all about it. I must go and make myself tidy. Going&nbsp; to tea with Demi. See you later.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Stammering, blushing, and looking both sheepish and gratified, Tom&nbsp; suddenly bolted, leaving the elder lady to enlighten the younger at&nbsp; length, and have another laugh over this new sort of courtship, which&nbsp; might well be called accidental. Nan was deeply interested, for she knew&nbsp; Dora, thought her a nice little thing, and predicted that in time she&nbsp; would make Tom an excellent wife, since she admired and <U+2018>appreciated<U+2019>&nbsp; him so much.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I shall miss him of course, but it will be a relief to me and better&nbsp; for him; dangling is so bad for a boy. Now he will go into business&nbsp; with his father and do well, and everyone be happy. I shall give Dora an&nbsp; elegant family medicine-chest for a wedding-present, and teach her how&nbsp; to use it. Tom can<U+2019>t be trusted, and is no more fit for the profession&nbsp; than Silas.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The latter part of this speech relieved Mrs Jo<U+2019>s mind, for Nan had&nbsp; looked about her as if she had lost something valuable when she began;&nbsp; but the medicine-chest seemed to cheer her, and the thought of Tom in a&nbsp; safe profession was evidently a great comfort.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The worm has turned at last, Nan, and your bond-man is free. Let him&nbsp; go, and give your whole mind to your work; for you are fitted for&nbsp; the profession, and will be an honour to it by and by,<U+2019> she said&nbsp; approvingly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I hope so. That reminds me--measles are in the village, and you had&nbsp; better tell the girls not to call where there are children. It would&nbsp; be bad to have a run of them just as term begins. Now I<U+2019>m off to Daisy.&nbsp; Wonder what she will say to Tom. Isn<U+2019>t he great fun?<U+2019> And Nan departed,&nbsp; laughing over the joke with such genuine satisfaction that it was&nbsp; evident no sentimental regrets disturbed her <U+2018>maiden meditation,&nbsp; fancy-free<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I shall have my eye on Demi, but won<U+2019>t say a word. Meg likes to manage&nbsp; her children in her own way, and a very good way it is. But the dear&nbsp; Pelican will be somewhat ruffled if her boy has caught the epidemic&nbsp; which seems to have broken out among us this summer.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo did not mean the measles, but that more serious malady called&nbsp; love, which is apt to ravage communities, spring and autumn, when winter&nbsp; gaiety and summer idleness produce whole bouquets of engagements, and&nbsp; set young people to pairing off like the birds. Franz began it, Nat was&nbsp; a chronic and Tom a sudden case; Demi seemed to have the symptoms; and&nbsp; worst of all, her own Ted had only the day before calmly said to her:&nbsp; <U+2018>Mum, I think I should be happier if I had a sweetheart, like the other&nbsp; boys.<U+2019> If her cherished son had asked her for dynamite to play with, she&nbsp; would hardly have been more startled, or have more decidedly refused the&nbsp; absurd request.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, Barry Morgan said I ought to have one and offered to pick me out&nbsp; a nice one among our set. I asked Josie first, and she hooted at the&nbsp; idea, so I thought I<U+2019>d let Barry look round. You say it steadies a&nbsp; fellow, and I want to be steady,<U+2019> explained Ted in a serious tone, which&nbsp; would have convulsed his parent at any other time.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Good lack! What are we coming to in this fast age when babes and boys&nbsp; make such demands and want to play with one of the most sacred things in&nbsp; life?<U+2019> exclaimed Mrs Jo, and having in a few words set the matter in its&nbsp; true light, sent her son away to wholesome baseball and Octoo for a safe&nbsp; sweetheart.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, here was Tom<U+2019>s bomb-shell to explode in their midst, carrying&nbsp; widespread destruction, perhaps; for though one swallow does not make a&nbsp; summer, one engagement is apt to make several, and her boys were, most&nbsp; of them, at the inflammable age when a spark ignites the flame, which&nbsp; soon flickers and dies out, or burns warm and clear for life. Nothing&nbsp; could be done about it but to help them make wise choices, and be worthy&nbsp; of good mates. But of all the lessons Mrs Jo had tried to teach her&nbsp; boys, this great one was the hardest; for love is apt to make lunatics&nbsp; of even saints and sages, so young people cannot be expected to escape&nbsp; the delusions, disappointments, and mistakes, as well as the delights,&nbsp; of this sweet madness.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I suppose it is inevitable, since we live in America, so I won<U+2019>t borrow&nbsp; trouble, but hope that some of the new ideas of education will produce a&nbsp; few hearty, happy, capable, and intelligent girls for my lads. Lucky for&nbsp; me that I haven<U+2019>t the whole twelve on my hands, I should lose my wits if&nbsp; I had, for I foresee complications and troubles ahead worse than Tom<U+2019>s&nbsp; boats, bicycles, donkeys, and Doras,<U+2019> meditated Mrs Jo, as she went back&nbsp; to her neglected proof-sheets.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom was quite satisfied with the tremendous effect his engagement&nbsp; produced in the little community at Plumfield.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It was paralysing,<U+2019> as Demi said; and astonishment left most of Tom<U+2019>s&nbsp; mates little breath for chaff. That he, the faithful one, should turn&nbsp; from the idol to strange goddesses, was a shock to the romantic and a&nbsp; warning to the susceptible. It was comical to see the airs our Thomas&nbsp; put on; for the most ludicrous parts of the affair were kindly buried in&nbsp; oblivion by the few who knew them, and Tom burst forth as a full-blown&nbsp; hero who had rescued the maiden from a watery grave, and won her&nbsp; gratitude and love by his daring deed. Dora kept the secret, and enjoyed&nbsp; the fun when she came to see Mother Bhaer and pay her respects to the&nbsp; family generally. Everyone liked her at once, for she was a gay and&nbsp; winning little soul; fresh, frank, and so happy, it was beautiful to see&nbsp; her innocent pride in Tom, who was a new boy, or man rather; for with&nbsp; this change in his life a great change took place in him. Jolly he would&nbsp; always be, and impulsive, but he tried to become all that Dora believed&nbsp; him, and his best side came uppermost for everyday wear. It was&nbsp; surprising to see how many good traits Tom had; and his efforts to&nbsp; preserve the manly dignity belonging to his proud position as an engaged&nbsp; man was very comical. So was the entire change from his former abasement&nbsp; and devotion to Nan to a somewhat lordly air with his little betrothed;&nbsp; for Dora made an idol of him, and resented the idea of a fault or a flaw&nbsp; in her Tom. This new state of things suited both, and the once blighted&nbsp; being bloomed finely in the warm atmosphere of appreciation, love, and&nbsp; confidence. He was very fond of the dear girl, but meant to be a slave&nbsp; no longer, and enjoyed his freedom immensely, quite unconscious that the&nbsp; great tyrant of the world had got hold of him for life.&nbsp; &nbsp; To his father<U+2019>s satisfaction he gave up his medical studies, and&nbsp; prepared to go into business with the old gentleman, who was a&nbsp; flourishing merchant, ready now to make the way smooth and smile upon&nbsp; his marriage with Mr West<U+2019>s well-endowed daughter. The only thorn in&nbsp; Tom<U+2019>s bed of roses was Nan<U+2019>s placid interest in his affairs, and evident&nbsp; relief at his disloyalty. He did not want her to suffer, but a decent&nbsp; amount of regret at the loss of such a lover would have gratified him;&nbsp; a slight melancholy, a word of reproach, a glance of envy as he passed&nbsp; with adoring Dora on his arm, seemed but the fitting tribute to such&nbsp; years of faithful service and sincere affection. But Nan regarded him&nbsp; with a maternal sort of air that nettled him very much, and patted&nbsp; Dora<U+2019>s curly head with a worldlywise air worthy of the withered&nbsp; spinster, Julia Mills, in David Copperfield.&nbsp; &nbsp; It took some time to get the old and the new emotions comfortably&nbsp; adjusted, but Mrs Jo helped him, and Mr Laurie gave him some wise advice&nbsp; upon the astonishing gymnastic feats the human heart can perform, and&nbsp; be all the better for it if it only held fast to the balancing-pole&nbsp; of truth and common sense. At last our Tommy got his bearings, and as&nbsp; autumn came on Plumfield saw but little of him; for his new lode star&nbsp; was in the city, and business kept him hard at work. He was evidently&nbsp; in his right place now, and soon throve finely, to his father<U+2019>s great&nbsp; contentment; for his jovial presence pervaded the once quiet office like&nbsp; a gale of fresh wind, and his lively wits found managing men and&nbsp; affairs much more congenial employment than studying disease, or playing&nbsp; unseemly pranks with skeletons.&nbsp; &nbsp; Here we will leave him for a time and turn to the more serious&nbsp; adventures of his mates, though this engagement, so merrily made, was&nbsp; the anchor which kept our mercurial Tom happy, and made a man of him.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 10. DEMI SETTLES&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mother, can I have a little serious conversation with you?<U+2019> asked Demi&nbsp; one evening, as they sat together enjoying the first fire of the season,&nbsp; while Daisy wrote letters upstairs and Josie was studying in the little&nbsp; library close by.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Certainly, dear. No bad news, I hope?<U+2019> and Mrs Meg looked up from her&nbsp; sewing with a mixture of pleasure and anxiety on her motherly face; for&nbsp; she dearly loved a good talk with her son, and knew that he always had&nbsp; something worth telling.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It will be good news for you, I think,<U+2019> answered Demi, smiling as he&nbsp; threw away his paper and went to sit beside her on the little sofa which&nbsp; just held two.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let me hear it, then, at once.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know you don<U+2019>t like the reporting, and will be glad to hear that I&nbsp; have given it up.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I am very glad! It is too uncertain a business, and there is no&nbsp; prospect of getting on for a long time. I want you settled in some good&nbsp; place where you can stay, and in time make money. I wish you liked a&nbsp; profession; but as you don<U+2019>t, any clean, well-established business will&nbsp; do.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What do you say to a railroad office?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t like it. A noisy, hurried kind of place, I know, with all sorts&nbsp; of rough men about. I hope it isn<U+2019>t that, dear?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I could have it; but does book-keeping in a wholesale leather business&nbsp; please you better?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No; you<U+2019>ll get round-shouldered writing at a tall desk; and they say,&nbsp; once a book-keeper always a book-keeper.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How does a travelling agent suit your views?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not at all; with all those dreadful accidents, and the exposure and bad&nbsp; food as you go from place to place, you are sure to get killed or lose&nbsp; your health.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I could be private secretary to a literary man; but the salary is&nbsp; small, and may end any time.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That would be better, and more what I want. It isn<U+2019>t that I object to&nbsp; honest work of any kind; but I don<U+2019>t want my son to spend his best years&nbsp; grubbing for a little money in a dark office, or be knocked about in a&nbsp; rough-and-tumble scramble to get on. I want to see you in some business&nbsp; where your tastes and talents can be developed and made useful; where&nbsp; you can go on rising, and in time put in your little fortune and be a&nbsp; partner; so that your years of apprenticeship will not be wasted, but&nbsp; fit you to take your place among the honourable men who make their&nbsp; lives and work useful and respected. I talked it all over with your dear&nbsp; father when you were a child; and if he had lived he would have shown&nbsp; you what I mean, and helped you to be what he was.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Meg wiped away a quiet tear as she spoke; for the memory of her&nbsp; husband was a very tender one, and the education of his children had&nbsp; been a sacred task to which she gave all her heart and life, and so&nbsp; far she had done wonderfully well--as her good son and loving daughters&nbsp; tried to prove. Demi<U+2019>s arm was round her now, as he said, in a voice so&nbsp; like his father<U+2019>s that it was the sweetest music to her ear:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mother dear, I think I have got just what you want for me; and it shall&nbsp; not be my fault if I don<U+2019>t become the man you hope to see me. Let me&nbsp; tell you all about it. I didn<U+2019>t say anything till it was sure because it&nbsp; would only worry you; but Aunt Jo and I have been on the look-out for it&nbsp; some time, and now it has come. You know her publisher, Mr Tiber, is one&nbsp; of the most successful men in the business; also generous, kind, and&nbsp; the soul of honour--as his treatment of Aunty proves. Well, I<U+2019>ve rather&nbsp; hankered for that place; for I love books, and as I can<U+2019>t make them I<U+2019>d&nbsp; like to publish them. That needs some literary taste and judgement, it&nbsp; brings you in contact with fine people, and is an education in itself.&nbsp; Whenever I go into that large, handsome room to see Mr Tiber for Aunt&nbsp; Jo, I always want to stay; for it<U+2019>s lined with books and pictures,&nbsp; famous men and women come and go, and Mr Tiber sits at his desk like&nbsp; a sort of king, receiving his subjects; for the greatest authors are&nbsp; humble to him, and wait his Yes or No with anxiety. Of course I<U+2019>ve&nbsp; nothing to do with all that, and may never have; but I like to see it,&nbsp; and the atmosphere is so different from the dark offices and hurly-burly&nbsp; of many other trades, where nothing but money is talked about, that it&nbsp; seems another world, and I feel at home in it. Yes, I<U+2019>d rather beat the&nbsp; door-mats and make fires there than be head clerk in the great hide and&nbsp; leather store at a big salary.<U+2019> Here Demi paused for breath; and Mrs&nbsp; Meg, whose face had been growing brighter and brighter, exclaimed&nbsp; eagerly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Just what I should like! Have you got it? Oh, my dear boy! your fortune&nbsp; is made if you go to that well-established and flourishing place, with&nbsp; those good men to help you along!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I think I have, but we mustn<U+2019>t be too sure of anything yet. I may not&nbsp; suit; I<U+2019>m only on trial, and must begin at the beginning and work my way&nbsp; up faithfully. Mr Tiber was very kind, and will push me on as fast as&nbsp; is fair to the other fellows, and as I prove myself fit to go up. I<U+2019>m to&nbsp; begin the first of next month in the book-room, filling orders; and I&nbsp; go round and get orders, and do various other things of the sort. I like&nbsp; it. I am ready to do anything about books, if it<U+2019>s only to dust them,<U+2019>&nbsp; laughed Demi, well pleased with his prospects, for, after trying various&nbsp; things, he seemed at last to have found the sort of work he liked, and a&nbsp; prospect that was very inviting to him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You inherit that love of books from grandpa; he can<U+2019>t live without&nbsp; them. I<U+2019>m glad of it. Tastes of that kind show a refined nature, and are&nbsp; both a comfort and a help all one<U+2019>s life. I am truly glad and grateful,&nbsp; John, that at last you want to settle, and have got such an entirely&nbsp; satisfactory place. Most boys begin much earlier; but I don<U+2019>t believe&nbsp; in sending them out to face the world so young, just when body and soul&nbsp; need home care and watchfulness. Now you are a man, and must begin your&nbsp; life for yourself. Do your best, and be as honest, useful, and happy as&nbsp; your father, and I won<U+2019>t care about making a fortune.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll try, mother. Couldn<U+2019>t have a better chance; for Tiber & Co. treat&nbsp; their people like gentlemen, and pay generously for faithful work.&nbsp; Things are done in a businesslike way there, and that suits me. I hate&nbsp; promises that are not kept, and shiftless or tyrannical ways anywhere.&nbsp; Mr Tiber said: <U+201C>This is only to teach you the ropes, Brooke; I shall&nbsp; have other work for you by and by.<U+201D> Aunty told him I had done book&nbsp; notices, and had rather a fancy for literature; so though I can<U+2019>t&nbsp; produce any <U+201C>works of Shakespeare<U+201D>, as she says, I may get up some&nbsp; little things later. If I don<U+2019>t, I think it a very honourable and noble&nbsp; profession to select and give good books to the world; and I<U+2019>m satisfied&nbsp; to be a humble helper in the work.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad you feel so. It adds so much to one<U+2019>s happiness to love the&nbsp; task one does. I used to hate teaching; but housekeeping for my own&nbsp; family was always sweet, though much harder in many ways. Isn<U+2019>t Aunt Jo&nbsp; pleased about all this?<U+2019> asked Mrs Meg, already seeing in her mind<U+2019>s&nbsp; eye a splendid sign with <U+2018>Tiber, Brooke & Co.<U+2019> over the door of a famous&nbsp; publishing house.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So pleased that I could hardly keep her from letting the cat out of the&nbsp; bag too soon. I<U+2019>ve had so many plans, and disappointed you so often, I&nbsp; wanted to be very sure this time. I had to bribe Rob and Ted to keep her&nbsp; at home tonight till I<U+2019>d told my news, she was eager to rush down and&nbsp; tell you herself. The castles that dear woman has built for me would&nbsp; fill all Spain, and have kept us jolly while we waited to know our fate.&nbsp; Mr Tiber doesn<U+2019>t do things in a hurry; but when he makes up his mind,&nbsp; you are all right; and I feel that I am fairly launched.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless you, dear, I hope so! It is a happy day for me, because I<U+2019>ve been&nbsp; so anxious lest, with all my care, I have been too easy and indulgent,&nbsp; and my boy, with his many good gifts, might fritter his time away in&nbsp; harmless but unsatisfactory things. Now I am at ease about you. If&nbsp; only Daisy can be happy, and Josie give up her dream, I shall be quite&nbsp; contented.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi let his mother enjoy herself for a few minutes, while he smiled&nbsp; over a certain little dream of his own, not ready yet for the telling;&nbsp; then he said, in the paternal tone which he unconsciously used when&nbsp; speaking of his sisters:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll see to the girls; but I begin to think grandpa is right in&nbsp; saying we must each be what God and nature makes us. We can<U+2019>t change it&nbsp; much--only help to develop the good and control the bad elements in us.&nbsp; I have fumbled my way into my right place at last, I hope. Let Daisy be&nbsp; happy in her way, since it is a good and womanly one. If Nat comes home&nbsp; all right, I<U+2019>d say: <U+201C>Bless you, my children,<U+201D> and give them a nest of&nbsp; their own. Then you and I will help little Jo to find out if it is to be&nbsp; <U+201C>All the world<U+2019>s a stage<U+201D> or <U+201C>Home, sweet home<U+201D>, for her.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I suppose we must, John; but I can<U+2019>t help making plans, and hoping they&nbsp; will come to pass. I see that Daisy is bound up in Nat; and if he is&nbsp; worthy of her I shall let them be happy in their own way, as my parents&nbsp; let me. But Josie will be a trial, I foresee; and much as I love the&nbsp; stage, and always did, I don<U+2019>t see how I can ever let my little girl be&nbsp; an actress, though she certainly has great talent for it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Whose fault is that?<U+2019> asked Demi, smiling, as he remembered his&nbsp; mother<U+2019>s early triumphs and unquenchable interest in the dramatic&nbsp; efforts of the young people round her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mine, I know. How could it be otherwise when I acted Babes in the Wood&nbsp; with you and Daisy before you could speak, and taught Josie to declaim&nbsp; Mother Goose in her cradle. Ah, me! the tastes of the mother come out in&nbsp; her children, and she must atone for them by letting them have their own&nbsp; way, I suppose.<U+2019> And Mrs Meg laughed, even while she shook her head over&nbsp; the undeniable fact that the Marches were a theatrical family.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Why not have a great actress of our name, as well as an authoress, a&nbsp; minister, and an eminent publisher? We don<U+2019>t choose our talents, but we&nbsp; needn<U+2019>t hide them in a napkin because they are not just what we want. I&nbsp; say, let Jo have her way, and do what she can. Here am I to take care of&nbsp; her; and you can<U+2019>t deny you<U+2019>d enjoy fixing her furbelows, and seeing her&nbsp; shine before the footlights, where you used to long to be. Come, mother,&nbsp; better face the music and march gaily, since your wilful children will&nbsp; <U+201C>gang their ain gait<U+201D>.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t see but I must, and <U+201C>leave the consequences to the Lord<U+201D>, as&nbsp; Marmee used to say when she had to decide, and only saw a step of the&nbsp; road. I should enjoy it immensely, if I could only feel that the life&nbsp; would not hurt my girl, and leave her unsatisfied when it was too late&nbsp; to change; for nothing is harder to give up than the excitements of that&nbsp; profession. I know something of it; and if your blessed father had not&nbsp; come along, I<U+2019>m afraid I should have been an actress in spite of Aunt&nbsp; March and all our honoured ancestors.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let Josie add new honour to the name, and work out the family talent&nbsp; in its proper place. I<U+2019>ll play dragon to her, and you play nurse, and&nbsp; no harm can come to our little Juliet, no matter how many Romeos spoon&nbsp; under her balcony. Really, ma<U+2019>am, opposition comes badly from an old&nbsp; lady who is going to wring the hearts of our audience in the heroine<U+2019>s&nbsp; part in Aunty<U+2019>s play next Christmas. It<U+2019>s the most pathetic thing I&nbsp; ever saw, mother; and I<U+2019>m sorry you didn<U+2019>t become an actress, though we&nbsp; should be nowhere if you had.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi was on his legs now, with his back to the fire, in the lordly&nbsp; attitude men like to assume when things go well with them, or they want&nbsp; to lay down the law on any subject.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Meg actually blushed at her son<U+2019>s hearty praise, and could not&nbsp; deny that the sound of applause was as sweet now as when she played the&nbsp; Witch<U+2019>s Curse and The Moorish Maiden<U+2019>s Vow long years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s perfectly absurd for me to do it, but I couldn<U+2019>t resist when Jo&nbsp; and Laurie made the part for me, and you children were to act in it. The&nbsp; minute I get on the old mother<U+2019>s dress I forget myself and feel the same&nbsp; thrill at the sound of the bell that I used to feel when we got up plays&nbsp; in the garret. If Daisy would only take the daughter<U+2019>s part it would&nbsp; be so complete; for with you and Josie I am hardly acting, it is all so&nbsp; real.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Especially the hospital scene, where you find the wounded son. Why,&nbsp; mother, do you know when we did that at last rehearsal my face was wet&nbsp; with real tears as you cried over me. It will bring down the house; but&nbsp; don<U+2019>t forget to wipe <U+2018>em off, or I shall sneeze,<U+2019> said Demi, laughing at&nbsp; the recollection of his mother<U+2019>s hit.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I won<U+2019>t; but it almost broke my heart to see you so pale and dreadful.&nbsp; I hope there will never be another war in my time, for I should have to&nbsp; let you go; and I never want to live through the same experience we had&nbsp; with father.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t you think Alice does the part better than Daisy would? Daisy&nbsp; hasn<U+2019>t a bit of the actress in her, and Alice puts life into the dullest&nbsp; words she speaks. I think the Marquise is just perfect in our piece,<U+2019>&nbsp; said Demi, strolling about the room as if the warmth of the fire sent a&nbsp; sudden colour to his face.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So do I. She is a dear girl, and I<U+2019>m proud and fond of her. Where is&nbsp; she tonight?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Pegging away at her Greek, I suppose. She usually is in the evening.&nbsp; More<U+2019>s the pity,<U+2019> added Demi, in a low tone, as he stared intently at&nbsp; the book-case, though he couldn<U+2019>t read a title.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now, there is a girl after my own heart. Pretty, well-bred,&nbsp; well-educated, and yet domestic, a real companion as well as help-meet&nbsp; for some good and intelligent man. I hope she will find one.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So do I,<U+2019> muttered Demi.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Meg had taken up her work again, and was surveying a half-finished&nbsp; buttonhole with so much interest that her son<U+2019>s face escaped her eye. He&nbsp; shed a beaming smile upon the rows of poets, as if even in their glass&nbsp; prison they could sympathize and rejoice with him at the first rosy dawn&nbsp; of the great passion which they knew so well. But Demi was a wise youth,&nbsp; and never leaped before looking carefully. He hardly knew his own heart&nbsp; yet, and was contented to wait till the sentiment, the fluttering of&nbsp; those folded wings he began to feel, should escape from the chrysalis&nbsp; and be ready to soar away in the sunshine to seek and claim its lovely&nbsp; mate. He had said nothing; but the brown eyes were eloquent, and there&nbsp; was an unconscious underplot to all the little plays he and Alice Heath&nbsp; acted so well together. She was busy with her books, bound to graduate&nbsp; with high honours, and he was trying to do the same in that larger&nbsp; college open to all, and where each man has his own prize to win or&nbsp; lose. Demi had nothing but himself to offer and, being a modest youth,&nbsp; considered that a poor gift till he had proved his power to earn his&nbsp; living, and the right to take a woman<U+2019>s happiness into his keeping.&nbsp; &nbsp; No one guessed that he had caught the fever except sharp-eyed Josie, and&nbsp; she, having a wholesome fear of her brother--who could be rather awful&nbsp; when she went too far--wisely contented herself with watching him like a&nbsp; little cat, ready to pounce on the first visible sign of weakness. Demi&nbsp; had taken to playing pensively upon his flute after he was in his&nbsp; room for the night, making this melodious friend his confidante, and&nbsp; breathing into it all the tender hopes and fears that filled his heart.&nbsp; Mrs Meg, absorbed in domestic affairs, and Daisy, who cared for no music&nbsp; but Nat<U+2019>s violin, paid no heed to these chamber concerts, but Josie&nbsp; always murmured to herself, with a naughty chuckle, <U+2018>Dick Swiveller is&nbsp; thinking of his Sophy Wackles,<U+2019> and bided her time to revenge certain&nbsp; wrongs inflicted upon her by Demi, who always took Daisy<U+2019>s side when she&nbsp; tried to curb the spirits of her unruly little sister.&nbsp; &nbsp; This evening she got her chance, and made the most of it. Mrs Meg was&nbsp; just rounding off her buttonhole, and Demi still strolling restlessly&nbsp; about the room, when a book was heard to slam in the study, followed by&nbsp; an audible yawn and the appearance of the student looking as if sleep&nbsp; and a desire for mischief were struggling which should be master.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I heard my name; have you been saying anything bad about me?<U+2019> she&nbsp; demanded, perching on the arm of an easychair.&nbsp; &nbsp; Her mother told the good news, over which Josie duly rejoiced, and Demi&nbsp; received her congratulations with a benignant air which made her feel&nbsp; that too much satisfaction was not good for him, and incited her to put&nbsp; a thorn into his bed of roses at once.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I caught something about the play just now, and I want to tell you that&nbsp; I<U+2019>m going to introduce a song into my part to liven it up a bit. How&nbsp; would this do?<U+2019> and seating herself at the piano she began to sing to&nbsp; these words the air of <U+2018>Kathleen Mavourneen<U+2019>:&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Sweetest of maidens, oh, how can I tell&nbsp;      The love that transfigures the whole earth to me?&nbsp;      The longing that causes my bosom to swell,&nbsp;      When I dream of a life all devoted to thee?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; She got no further, for Demi, red with wrath, made a rush at her, and&nbsp; the next moment a very agile young person was seen dodging round tables&nbsp; and chairs with the future partner of Tiber & Co. in hot pursuit. <U+2018>You&nbsp; monkey, how dare you meddle with my papers?<U+2019> cried the irate poet,&nbsp; making futile grabs at the saucy girl, who skipped to and fro, waving a&nbsp; bit of paper tantalizingly before him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Didn<U+2019>t; found it in the big <U+201C>Dic<U+201D>. Serves you right if you leave your&nbsp; rubbish about. Don<U+2019>t you like my song? It<U+2019>s very pretty.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll teach you one that you won<U+2019>t like if you don<U+2019>t give me my&nbsp; property.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come and get it if you can<U+2019>; and Josie vanished into the study to have&nbsp; out her squabble in peace, for Mrs Meg was already saying:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Children, children! don<U+2019>t quarrel.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The paper was in the fire by the time Demi arrived and he at once calmed&nbsp; down, seeing that the bone of contention was out of the way.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad it<U+2019>s burnt; I don<U+2019>t care for it, only some verse I was trying&nbsp; to set to music for one of the girls. But I<U+2019>ll trouble you to let my&nbsp; papers alone, or I shall take back the advice I gave mother tonight&nbsp; about allowing you to act as much as you like.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie was sobered at once by this dire threat, and in her most wheedling&nbsp; tone begged to know what he had said. By way of heaping coals of fire&nbsp; on her head he told her, and this diplomatic performance secured him an&nbsp; ally on the spot.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You dear old boy! I<U+2019>ll never tease you again though you moon and spoon&nbsp; both day and night. If you stand by me, I<U+2019>ll stand by you and never say&nbsp; a word. See here! I<U+2019>ve got a note for you from Alice. Won<U+2019>t that be a&nbsp; peace-offering and soothe your little feelings?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi<U+2019>s eyes sparkled as Josie held up a paper cocked hat, but as he&nbsp; knew what was probably in it, he took the wind out of Josie<U+2019>s sails, and&nbsp; filled her with blank astonishment by saying carelessly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s nothing; it<U+2019>s only to say whether she will go to the concert&nbsp; with us tomorrow night. You can read it if you like.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; With the natural perversity of her sex Josie ceased to be curious the&nbsp; moment she was told to read it, and meekly handed it over; but she&nbsp; watched Demi as he calmly read the two lines it contained and then threw&nbsp; it into the fire. <U+2018>Why, Jack, I thought you<U+2019>d treasure every scrap the&nbsp; <U+201C>sweetest maid<U+201D> touched. Don<U+2019>t you care for her?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very much; we all do; but <U+201C>mooning and spooning<U+201D>, as you elegantly&nbsp; express it, is not in my line. My dear little girl, your plays make you&nbsp; romantic, and because Alice and I act lovers sometimes you take it into&nbsp; your silly head that we are really so. Don<U+2019>t waste time hunting mares&nbsp; nests, but attend to your own affairs and leave me to mine. I forgive&nbsp; you, but don<U+2019>t do it again; it<U+2019>s bad taste, and tragedy queens don<U+2019>t&nbsp; romp.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The last cut finished Josie; she humbly begged pardon and went off to&nbsp; bed, while Demi soon followed, feeling that he had not only settled&nbsp; himself but his too inquisitive little sister also. But if he had seen&nbsp; her face as she listened to the soft wailing of his flute he would not&nbsp; have been so sure, for she looked as cunning as a magpie as she said,&nbsp; with a scornful sniff: <U+2018>Pooh, you can<U+2019>t deceive me; I know Dick is&nbsp; serenading Sophy Wackles.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 11. EMIL<U+2019>S THANKSGIVING&nbsp; &nbsp; The Brenda was scudding along with all sail set to catch the rising&nbsp; wind, and everyone on board was rejoicing, for the long voyage was&nbsp; drawing towards an end.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Four weeks more, Mrs Hardy, and we<U+2019>ll give you a cup of tea such as you&nbsp; never had before,<U+2019> said second mate Hoffmann, as he paused beside two&nbsp; ladies sitting in a sheltered corner of the deck.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I shall be glad to get it, and still gladder to put my feet on solid&nbsp; ground,<U+2019> answered the elder lady, smiling; for our friend Emil was&nbsp; a favourite, as well he might be, since he devoted himself to the&nbsp; captain<U+2019>s wife and daughter, who were the only passengers on board.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So shall I, even if I have to wear a pair of shoes like Chinese junks.&nbsp; I<U+2019>ve tramped up and down the deck so much, I shall be barefooted if&nbsp; we don<U+2019>t arrive soon,<U+2019> laughed Mary, the daughter, showing two shabby&nbsp; little boots as she glanced up at the companion of these tramps,&nbsp; remembering gratefully how pleasant he had made them.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t think there are any small enough in China,<U+2019> answered Emil, with a&nbsp; sailor<U+2019>s ready gallantry, privately resolving to hunt up the handsomest&nbsp; shoes he could find the moment he landed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t know what you would have done for exercise, dear, if Mr&nbsp; Hoffmann had not made you walk every day. This lazy life is bad for&nbsp; young people, though it suits an old body like me well enough in calm&nbsp; weather. Is this likely to be a gale, think ye?<U+2019> added Mrs Hardy, with&nbsp; an anxious glance at the west, where the sun was setting redly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Only a capful of wind, ma<U+2019>am, just enough to send us along lively,<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Emil, with a comprehensive glance aloft and alow.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Please sing, Mr Hoffmann, it<U+2019>s so pleasant to have music at this&nbsp; time. We shall miss it very much when we get ashore,<U+2019> said Mary, in&nbsp; a persuasive tone which would have won melody from a shark, if such a&nbsp; thing were possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil had often blessed his one accomplishment during these months, for&nbsp; it cheered the long days, and made the twilight hour his happiest&nbsp; time, wind and weather permitting. So now he gladly tuned his pipe, and&nbsp; leaning on the taffrail near the girl, watched the brown locks blowing&nbsp; in the wind as he sang her favourite song:&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Give me freshening breeze, my boys,&nbsp;      A white and swelling sail,&nbsp;      A ship that cuts the dashing waves,&nbsp;      And weathers every gale.&nbsp;      What life is like a sailor<U+2019>s life,&nbsp;      So free, so bold, so brave?&nbsp;      His home the ocean<U+2019>s wide expanse,&nbsp;      A coral bed his grave.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as the last notes of the clear, strong voice died away, Mrs Hardy&nbsp; suddenly exclaimed: <U+2018>What<U+2019>s that?<U+2019> Emil<U+2019>s quick eye saw at once the&nbsp; little puff of smoke coming up a hatchway where no smoke should be, and&nbsp; his heart seemed to stand still for an instant as the dread word <U+2018>Fire!<U+2019>&nbsp; flashed through his mind. Then he was quite steady, and strolled away&nbsp; saying quietly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Smoking not allowed there, I<U+2019>ll go and stop it.<U+2019> But the instant he&nbsp; was out of sight his face changed, and he leaped down the hatchway,&nbsp; thinking, with a queer smile on his lips: <U+2018>If we are afire, shouldn<U+2019>t&nbsp; wonder if I did make a coral bed my grave!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; He was gone a few minutes, and when he came up, half stifled with smoke,&nbsp; he was as white as a very brown man could be, but calm and cool as he&nbsp; went to report to the captain.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Fire in the hold, sir.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t frighten the women,<U+2019> was Captain Hardy<U+2019>s first order; then both&nbsp; be stirred themselves to discover how strong the treacherous enemy was,&nbsp; and to rout it if possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Brenda<U+2019>s cargo was a very combustible one, and in spite of the&nbsp; streams of water poured into the hold it was soon evident that the ship&nbsp; was doomed. Smoke began to ooze up between the planks everywhere, and&nbsp; the rising gale soon fanned the smouldering fire to flames that began&nbsp; to break out here and there, telling the dreadful truth too plainly for&nbsp; anyone to hide. Mrs Hardy and Mary bore the shock bravely when told to&nbsp; be ready to quit the ship at a minute<U+2019>s notice; the boats were hastily&nbsp; prepared, and the men worked with a will to batten down every loophole&nbsp; whence the fire might escape. Soon the poor Brenda was a floating&nbsp; furnace, and the order to <U+2018>Take to the boats!<U+2019> came for all. The women&nbsp; first, of course, and it was fortunate that, being a merchantman, there&nbsp; were no more passengers on board, so there was no panic, and one after&nbsp; the other the boats pushed off. That in which the women were lingered&nbsp; near, for the brave captain would be the last to leave his ship.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil stayed by him till ordered away, and reluctantly obeyed; but it was&nbsp; well for him he went, for just as he had regained the boat, rocking far&nbsp; below, half hidden by a cloud of smoke, a mast, undermined by the&nbsp; fire now raging in the bowels of the ship, fell with a crash, knocking&nbsp; Captain Hardy overboard. The boat soon reached him as he floated out&nbsp; from the wreck, and Emil sprung into the sea to rescue him, for he was&nbsp; wounded and senseless. This accident made it necessary for the young man&nbsp; to take command, and he at once ordered the men to pull for their lives,&nbsp; as an explosion might occur at any moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; The other boats were out of danger and all lingered to watch the&nbsp; splendid yet awesome spectacle of the burning ship alone on the wide&nbsp; sea, reddening the night and casting a lurid glare upon the water, where&nbsp; floated the frail boats filled with pale faces, all turned for a last&nbsp; look at the fated Brenda, slowly settling to her watery grave. No one&nbsp; saw the end, however, for the gale soon swept the watchers far away and&nbsp; separated them, some never to meet again till the sea gives up its dead.&nbsp; &nbsp; The boat whose fortunes we must follow was alone when dawn came up,&nbsp; showing these survivors all the dangers of their situation. Food and&nbsp; water had been put in, and such provision for comfort and safety as time&nbsp; allowed; but it was evident that with a badly wounded man, two women,&nbsp; and seven sailors, their supply would not last long, and help was sorely&nbsp; needed. Their only hope was in meeting a ship, although the gale, which&nbsp; had raged all night, had blown them out of their course. To this hope&nbsp; all clung, and wiled away the weary hours, watching the horizon and&nbsp; cheering one another with prophecies of speedy rescue.&nbsp; &nbsp; Second mate Hoffmann was very brave and helpful, though his unexpected&nbsp; responsibility weighed heavily on his shoulders; for the captain<U+2019>s state&nbsp; seemed desperate, the poor wife<U+2019>s grief wrung his heart, and the blind&nbsp; confidence of the young girl in his power to save them made him feel&nbsp; that no sign of doubt or fear must lessen it. The men did their part&nbsp; readily now, but Emil knew that if starvation and despair made brutes of&nbsp; them, his task might be a terrible one. So he clutched his courage with&nbsp; both hands, kept up a manly front, and spoke so cheerily of their good&nbsp; chances, that all instinctively turned to him for guidance and support.&nbsp; &nbsp; The first day and night passed in comparative comfort, but when the&nbsp; third came, things looked dark and hope began to fail. The wounded man&nbsp; was delirious, the wife worn out with anxiety and suspense, the girl&nbsp; weak for want of food, having put away half her biscuit for her mother,&nbsp; and given her share of water to wet her father<U+2019>s feverish lips. The&nbsp; sailors ceased rowing and sat grimly waiting, openly reproaching their&nbsp; leader for not following their advice, others demanding more food, all&nbsp; waxing dangerous as privation and pain brought out the animal instincts&nbsp; lurking in them. Emil did his best, but mortal man was helpless there,&nbsp; and he could only turn his haggard face from the pitiless sky, that&nbsp; dropped no rain for their thirst, to the boundless sea where no sail&nbsp; appeared to gladden their longing eyes. All day he tried to cheer and&nbsp; comfort them, while hunger gnawed, thirst parched, and growing fear lay&nbsp; heavy at his heart. He told stories to the men, implored them to bear up&nbsp; for the helpless women<U+2019>s sake, and promised rewards if they would pull&nbsp; while they had strength to regain the lost route, as nearly as he could&nbsp; make it out, and increase their chance of rescue. He rigged an awning&nbsp; of sailcloth over the suffering man and tended him like a son, comforted&nbsp; the wife, and tried to make the pale girl forget herself, by singing&nbsp; every song he knew or recounting his adventures by land and sea, till&nbsp; she smiled and took heart; for all ended well.&nbsp; &nbsp; The fourth day came and the supply of food and water was nearly gone.&nbsp; Emil proposed to keep it for the sick man and the women, but two of the&nbsp; men rebelled, demanding their share. Emil gave up his as an example, and&nbsp; several of the good fellows followed it, with the quiet heroism which so&nbsp; often crops up in rough but manly natures. This shamed the others,&nbsp; and for another day an ominous peace reigned in that little world of&nbsp; suffering and suspense. But during the night, while Emil, worn out with&nbsp; fatigue, left the watch to the most trustworthy sailor, that he might&nbsp; snatch an hour<U+2019>s rest, these two men got at the stores and stole the&nbsp; last of the bread and water, and the one bottle of brandy, which was&nbsp; carefully hoarded to keep up their strength and make the brackish water&nbsp; drinkable. Half mad with thirst, they drank greedily and by morning one&nbsp; was in a stupor, from which he never woke; the other so crazed by&nbsp; the strong stimulant, that when Emil tried to control him, he leaped&nbsp; overboard and was lost. Horror-stricken by this terrible scene, the&nbsp; other men were submissive henceforth, and the boat floated on and on&nbsp; with its sad freight of suffering souls and bodies.&nbsp; &nbsp; Another trial came to them that left all more despairing than before. A&nbsp; sail appeared, and for a time a frenzy of joy prevailed, to be turned&nbsp; to bitterest disappointment when it passed by, too far away to see&nbsp; the signals waved to them or hear the frantic cries for help that rang&nbsp; across the sea. Emil<U+2019>s heart sank then, for the captain seemed dying,&nbsp; and the women could not hold out much longer. He kept up till night&nbsp; came; then in the darkness, broken only by the feeble murmuring of the&nbsp; sick man, the whispered prayers of the poor wife, the ceaseless swash of&nbsp; waves, Emil hid his face, and had an hour of silent agony that aged him&nbsp; more than years of happy life could have done. It was not the physical&nbsp; hardship that daunted him, though want and weakness tortured him; it was&nbsp; his dreadful powerlessness to conquer the cruel fate that seemed hanging&nbsp; over them. The men he cared little for, since these perils were but a&nbsp; part of the life they chose; but the master he loved, the good woman who&nbsp; had been so kind to him, the sweet girl whose winsome presence had made&nbsp; the long voyage so pleasant for them all--if he could only save these&nbsp; dear and innocent creatures from a cruel death, he felt that he could&nbsp; willingly give his life for them.&nbsp; &nbsp; As he sat there with his head in his hands, bowed down by the first&nbsp; great trial of his young life, the starless sky overhead, the restless&nbsp; sea beneath, and all around him suffering, for which he had no help, a&nbsp; soft sound broke the silence, and he listened like one in a dream. It&nbsp; was Mary singing to her mother, who lay sobbing in her arms, spent with&nbsp; this long anguish. A very faint and broken voice it was, for the poor&nbsp; girl<U+2019>s lips were parched with thirst; but the loving heart turned&nbsp; instinctively to the great Helper in this hour of despair, and He heard&nbsp; her feeble cry. It was a sweet old hymn often sung at Plumfield; and as&nbsp; he listened, all the happy past came back so clearly that Emil forgot&nbsp; the bitter present, and was at home again. His talk on the housetop&nbsp; with Aunt Jo seemed but yesterday, and, with a pang of self-reproach, he&nbsp; thought:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The scarlet strand! I must remember it, and do my duty to the end.&nbsp; Steer straight, old boy; and if you can<U+2019>t come into port, go down with&nbsp; all sail set.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, as the soft voice crooned on to lull the weary woman to a&nbsp; fitful sleep, Emil for a little while forgot his burden in a dream of&nbsp; Plumfield. He saw them all, heard the familiar voices, felt the grip of&nbsp; welcoming hands, and seemed to say to himself: <U+2018>Well, they shall not be&nbsp; ashamed of me if I never see them any more.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; A sudden shout startled him from that brief rest, and a drop on his&nbsp; forehead told him that the blessed rain had come at last, bringing&nbsp; salvation with it; for thirst is harder to bear than hunger, heat, or&nbsp; cold. Welcomed by cries of joy, all lifted up their parched lips, held&nbsp; out their hands, and spread their garments to catch the great drops that&nbsp; soon came pouring down to cool the sick man<U+2019>s fever, quench the agony of&nbsp; thirst, and bring refreshment to every weary body in the boat. All night&nbsp; it fell, all night the castaways revelled in the saving shower, and took&nbsp; heart again, like dying plants revived by heaven<U+2019>s dew. The clouds broke&nbsp; away at dawn, and Emil sprung up, wonderfully braced and cheered by&nbsp; those hours of silent gratitude for this answer to their cry for help.&nbsp; But this was not all; as his eye swept the horizon, clear against the&nbsp; rosy sky shone the white sails of a ship, so near that they could see&nbsp; the pennon at her mast-head and black figures moving on the deck.&nbsp; &nbsp; One cry broke from all those eager throats, and rang across the sea, as&nbsp; every man waved hat or handkerchief and the women stretched imploring&nbsp; hands towards this great white angel of deliverance coming down upon&nbsp; them as if the fresh wind filled every sail to help her on.&nbsp; &nbsp; No disappointment now; answering signals assured them of help; and in&nbsp; the rapture of that moment the happy women fell on Emil<U+2019>s neck,&nbsp; giving him his reward in tears and blessings as their grateful hearts&nbsp; overflowed. He always said that was the proudest moment of his life,&nbsp; as he stood there holding Mary in his arms; for the brave girl, who had&nbsp; kept up so long, broke down then, and clung to him half fainting; while&nbsp; her mother busied herself about the invalid, who seemed to feel the&nbsp; joyful stir, and gave an order, as if again on the deck of his lost&nbsp; ship.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was soon over; and then all were safely aboard the good Urania,&nbsp; homeward bound. Emil saw his friends in tender hands, his men among&nbsp; their mates, and told the story of the wreck before he thought of&nbsp; himself. The savoury odour of the soup, carried by to the cabin for the&nbsp; ladies, reminded him that he was starving, and a sudden stagger&nbsp; betrayed his weakness. He was instantly borne away, to be half killed by&nbsp; kindness, and being fed, clothed, and comforted, was left to rest. Just&nbsp; as the surgeon left the state-room, he asked in his broken voice: <U+2018>What&nbsp; day is this? My head is so confused, I<U+2019>ve lost my reckoning.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thanksgiving Day, man! And we<U+2019>ll give you a regular New England dinner,&nbsp; if you<U+2019>ll eat it,<U+2019> answered the surgeon heartily.&nbsp; &nbsp; But Emil was too spent to do anything, except lie still and give thanks,&nbsp; more fervently and gratefully than ever before, for the blessed gift of&nbsp; life, which was the sweeter for a sense of duty faithfully performed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 12. DAN<U+2019>S CHRISTMAS&nbsp; &nbsp; Where was Dan? In prison. Alas for Mrs Jo! how her heart would have&nbsp; ached if she had known that while old Plum shone with Christmas cheer&nbsp; her boy sat alone in his cell, trying to read the little book she&nbsp; gave him, with eyes dimmed now and then by the hot tears no physical&nbsp; suffering had ever wrung from him, and longing with a homesick heart for&nbsp; all that he had lost.&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, Dan was in prison; but no cry for help from him as he faced the&nbsp; terrible strait he was in with the dumb despair of an Indian at the&nbsp; stake; for his own bosom sin had brought him there, and this was to&nbsp; be the bitter lesson that tamed the lawless spirit and taught him&nbsp; self-control.&nbsp; &nbsp; The story of his downfall is soon told; for it came, as so often&nbsp; happens, just when he felt unusually full of high hopes, good&nbsp; resolutions, and dreams of a better life. On his journey he met a&nbsp; pleasant young fellow, and naturally felt an interest in him, as&nbsp; Blair was on his way to join his elder brothers on a ranch in Kansas.&nbsp; Card-playing was going on in the smoking-car, and the lad--for he was&nbsp; barely twenty--tired with the long journey, beguiled the way with such&nbsp; partners as appeared, being full of spirits, and a little intoxicated&nbsp; with the freedom of the West. Dan, true to his promise, would not join,&nbsp; but watched with intense interest the games that went on, and soon made&nbsp; up his mind that two of the men were sharpers anxious to fleece the boy,&nbsp; who had imprudently displayed a well-filled pocket-book. Dan always had&nbsp; a soft spot in his heart for any younger, weaker creature whom he met,&nbsp; and something about the lad reminded him of Teddy; so he kept an eye on&nbsp; Blair, and warned him against his new friends.&nbsp; &nbsp; Vainly, of course; for when all stopped overnight in one of the great&nbsp; cities, Dan missed the boy from the hotel whither he had taken him&nbsp; for safe-keeping; and learning who had come for him, went to find him,&nbsp; calling himself a fool for his pains, yet unable to leave the confiding&nbsp; boy to the dangers that surrounded him.&nbsp; &nbsp; He found him gambling in a low place with the men, who were bound to&nbsp; have his money; and by the look of relief on Blair<U+2019>s anxious face when&nbsp; he saw him Dan knew without words that things were going badly with him,&nbsp; and he saw the peril too late.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I can<U+2019>t come yet--I<U+2019>ve lost; it<U+2019>s not my money; I must get it back, or&nbsp; I dare not face my brothers,<U+2019> whispered the poor lad, when Dan begged&nbsp; him to get away without further loss. Shame and fear made him desperate;&nbsp; and he played on, sure that he could recover the money confided to&nbsp; his care. Seeing Dan<U+2019>s resolute face, keen eye, and travelled air, the&nbsp; sharpers were wary, played fair, and let the boy win a little; but they&nbsp; had no mind to give up their prey, and finding that Dan stood sentinel&nbsp; at the boy<U+2019>s back, an ominous glance was exchanged between them, which&nbsp; meant:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We must get this fellow out of the way.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan saw it, and was on his guard; for he and Blair were strangers, evil&nbsp; deeds are easily done in such places, and no tales told. But he would&nbsp; not desert the boy, and still kept watch of every card till he plainly&nbsp; detected false play, and boldly said so. High words passed, Dan<U+2019>s&nbsp; indignation overcame his prudence; and when the cheat refused to restore&nbsp; his plunder with insulting words and drawn pistol, Dan<U+2019>s hot temper&nbsp; flashed out, and he knocked the man down with a blow that sent him&nbsp; crashing head first against a stove, to roll senseless and bleeding to&nbsp; the floor. A wild scene followed, but in the midst of it Dan whispered&nbsp; to the boy: <U+2018>Get away, and hold your tongue. Don<U+2019>t mind me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Frightened and bewildered, Blair quitted the city at once, leaving Dan&nbsp; to pass the night in the lock-up, and a few days later to stand in court&nbsp; charged with manslaughter; for the man was dead. Dan had no friends, and&nbsp; having once briefly told the story, held his peace, anxious to keep all&nbsp; knowledge of this sad affair from those at home. He even concealed his&nbsp; name--giving that of David Kent, as he had done several times before in&nbsp; emergencies. It was all over very soon; but as there were extenuating&nbsp; circumstances his sentence was a year in prison, with hard labour.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dazed by the rapidity with which this horrible change in his life came&nbsp; upon him, Dan did not fully realize it till the iron door clanged behind&nbsp; him and he sat alone in a cell as narrow, cold, and silent as a tomb. He&nbsp; knew that a word would bring Mr Laurie to help and comfort him; but he&nbsp; could not bear to tell of this disgrace, or see the sorrow and the shame&nbsp; it would cause the friends who hoped so much for him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No,<U+2019> he said, clenching his fist, <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll let them think me dead first.&nbsp; I shall be if I am kept here long<U+2019>; and he sprang up to pace the stone&nbsp; floor like a caged lion, with a turmoil of wrath and grief, rebellion&nbsp; and remorse, seething in heart and brain, till he felt as if he should&nbsp; go mad and beat upon the walls that shut him away from the liberty which&nbsp; was his life. For days he suffered terribly, then worn out, sank into a&nbsp; black melancholy sadder to see than his excitement.&nbsp; &nbsp; The warden of this prison was a rough man who had won the ill will of&nbsp; all by unnecessary harshness, but the chaplain was full of sympathy, and&nbsp; did his hard duty faithfully and tenderly. He laboured with poor Dan,&nbsp; but seemed to make no impression, and was forced to wait till work had&nbsp; soothed the excited nerves and captivity tamed the proud spirit that&nbsp; would suffer but not complain.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan was put in the brush-shop, and feeling that activity was his only&nbsp; salvation, worked with a feverish energy that soon won the approval of&nbsp; the master and the envy of less skilful mates. Day after day he sat in&nbsp; his place, watched by an armed overseer, forbidden any but necessary&nbsp; words, no intercourse with the men beside him, no change but from cell&nbsp; to shop, no exercise but the dreary marches to and fro, each man<U+2019>s hand&nbsp; on the other<U+2019>s shoulder keeping step with the dreary tramp so different&nbsp; from the ringing tread of soldiers. Silent, gaunt, and grim, Dan did his&nbsp; daily task, ate his bitter bread, and obeyed commands with a rebellious&nbsp; flash of the eye, that made the warden say:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s a dangerous man. Watch him. He<U+2019>ll break out some day.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; There were others more dangerous than he, because older in crime&nbsp; and ready for any desperate outbreak to change the monotony of long&nbsp; sentences. These men soon divined Dan<U+2019>s mood, and in the mysterious way&nbsp; convicts invent, managed to convey to him before a month was over&nbsp; that plans were being made for a mutiny at the first opportunity.&nbsp; Thanksgiving Day was one of the few chances for them to speak together&nbsp; as they enjoyed an hour of freedom in the prison yard. Then all would&nbsp; be settled and the rash attempt made if possible, probably to end in&nbsp; bloodshed and defeat for most, but liberty for a few. Dan had already&nbsp; planned his own escape and bided his time, growing more and more moody,&nbsp; fierce, and rebellious, as loss of liberty wore upon soul and body; for&nbsp; this sudden change from his free, healthy life to such a narrow, gloomy,&nbsp; and miserable one, could not but have a terrible effect upon one of&nbsp; Dan<U+2019>s temperament and age.&nbsp; &nbsp; He brooded over his ruined life, gave up all his happy hopes and plans,&nbsp; felt that he could never face dear old Plumfield again, or touch those&nbsp; friendly hands, with the stain of blood upon his own. He did not care&nbsp; for the wretched man whom he had killed, for such a life was better&nbsp; ended, he thought; but the disgrace of prison would never be wiped out&nbsp; of his memory, though the cropped hair would grow again, the grey suit&nbsp; easily be replaced, and the bolts and bars left far behind.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s all over with me; I<U+2019>ve spoilt my life, now let it go. I<U+2019>ll give up&nbsp; the fight and get what pleasure I can anywhere, anyhow. They shall think&nbsp; me dead and so still care for me, but never know what I am. Poor Mother&nbsp; Bhaer! she tried to help me, but it<U+2019>s no use; the firebrand can<U+2019>t be&nbsp; saved.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; And dropping his head in his hands as he sat on his low bed, Dan would&nbsp; mourn over all he had lost in tearless misery, till merciful sleep would&nbsp; comfort him with dreams of the happy days when the boys played together,&nbsp; or those still later and happier ones when all smiled on him, and&nbsp; Plumfield seemed to have gained a new and curious charm.&nbsp; &nbsp; There was one poor fellow in Dan<U+2019>s shop whose fate was harder than his,&nbsp; for his sentence expired in the spring, but there was little hope of his&nbsp; living till that time; and the coldest-hearted man pitied poor Mason as&nbsp; he sat coughing his life away in that close place and counting the weary&nbsp; days yet to pass before he could see his wife and little child again.&nbsp; There was some hope that he might be pardoned out, but he had no friends&nbsp; to bestir themselves in the matter, and it was evident that the great&nbsp; Judge<U+2019>s pardon would soon end his patient pain for ever.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan pitied him more than he dared to show, and this one tender emotion&nbsp; in that dark time was like the little flower that sprung up between the&nbsp; stones of the prison yard and saved the captive from despair, in the&nbsp; beautiful old story. Dan helped Mason with his work when he was too&nbsp; feeble to finish his task, and the grateful look that thanked him was&nbsp; a ray of sunshine to cheer his cell when he was alone. Mason envied the&nbsp; splendid health of his neighbour, and mourned to see it wasting there.&nbsp; He was a peaceful soul and tried, as far as a whispered word or warning&nbsp; glance could do it, to deter Dan from joining the <U+2018>bad lot<U+2019>, as the&nbsp; rebels were called. But having turned his face from the light, Dan found&nbsp; the downward way easy, and took a grim satisfaction in the prospect of&nbsp; a general outbreak during which he might revenge himself upon the&nbsp; tyrannical warden, and strike a blow for his own liberty, feeling that&nbsp; an hour of insurrection would be a welcome vent for the pent-up passions&nbsp; that tormented him. He had tamed many a wild animal, but his own lawless&nbsp; spirit was too much for him, till he found the curb that made him master&nbsp; of himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Sunday before Thanksgiving, as he sat in chapel, Dan observed&nbsp; several guests in the seats reserved for them, and looked anxiously&nbsp; to see if any familiar face was there; for he had a mortal fear that&nbsp; someone from home would suddenly confront him. No, all were strangers,&nbsp; and he soon forgot them in listening to the chaplain<U+2019>s cheerful words,&nbsp; and the sad singing of many heavy hearts. People often spoke to the&nbsp; convicts, so it caused no surprise when, on being invited to address&nbsp; them, one of the ladies rose and said she would tell them a little&nbsp; story; which announcement caused the younger listeners to pack up their&nbsp; ears, and even the older ones to look interested; for any change in&nbsp; their monotonous life was welcome.&nbsp; &nbsp; The speaker was a middle-aged woman in black, with a sympathetic face,&nbsp; eyes full of compassion, and a voice that seemed to warm the heart,&nbsp; because of certain motherly tones in it. She reminded Dan of Mrs Jo, and&nbsp; he listened intently to every word, feeling that each was meant for him,&nbsp; because by chance, they came at the moment when he needed a softening&nbsp; memory to break up the ice of despair which was blighting all the good&nbsp; impulses of his nature.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a very simple little story, but it caught the men<U+2019>s attention at&nbsp; once, being about two soldiers in a hospital during the late war,&nbsp; both badly wounded in the right arm, and both anxious to save these&nbsp; breadwinners and go home unmaimed. One was patient, docile, and&nbsp; cheerfully obeyed orders, even when told that the arm must go. He&nbsp; submitted and after much suffering recovered, grateful for life, though&nbsp; he could fight no more. The other rebelled, would listen to no advice,&nbsp; and having delayed too long, died a lingering death, bitterly regretting&nbsp; his folly when it was too late. <U+2018>Now, as all stories should have a&nbsp; little moral, let me tell you mine,<U+2019> added the lady, with a smile, as&nbsp; she looked at the row of young men before her, sadly wondering what&nbsp; brought them there.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This is a hospital for soldiers wounded in life<U+2019>s battle; here are sick&nbsp; souls, weak wills, insane passions, blind consciences, all the ills that&nbsp; come from broken laws, bringing their inevitable pain and punishment&nbsp; with them, There is hope and help for every one, for God<U+2019>s mercy is&nbsp; infinite and man<U+2019>s charity is great; but penitence and submission must&nbsp; come before the cure is possible. Pay the forfeit manfully, for it is&nbsp; just; but from the suffering and shame wring new strength for a nobler&nbsp; life. The scar will remain, but it is better for a man to lose both arms&nbsp; than his soul; and these hard years, instead of being lost, may be made&nbsp; the most precious of your lives, if they teach you to rule yourselves. O&nbsp; friends, try to outlive the bitter past, to wash the sin away, and begin&nbsp; anew. If not for your own sakes, for that of the dear mothers, wives,&nbsp; and children, who wait and hope so patiently for you. Remember them,&nbsp; and do not let them love and long in vain. And if there be any here&nbsp; so forlorn that they have no friend to care for them, never forget the&nbsp; Father whose arms are always open to receive, forgive, and comfort&nbsp; His prodigal sons, even at the eleventh hour.<U+2019> There the little sermon&nbsp; ended; but the preacher of it felt that her few hearty words had not&nbsp; been uttered in vain, for one boy<U+2019>s head was down, and several faces&nbsp; wore the softened look which told that a tender memory was touched. Dan&nbsp; was forced to set his lips to keep them steady, and drop his eyes to&nbsp; hide the sudden dew that dimmed them when waiting, hoping friends were&nbsp; spoken of. He was glad to be alone in his cell again, and sat thinking&nbsp; deeply, instead of trying to forget himself in sleep. It seemed as if&nbsp; those words were just what he needed to show him where he stood and how&nbsp; fateful the next few days might be to him. Should he join the <U+2018>bad lot<U+2019>,&nbsp; and perhaps add another crime to the one already committed, lengthen the&nbsp; sentence already so terrible to bear, deliberately turn his back on all&nbsp; that was good, and mar the future that might yet be redeemed? Or should&nbsp; he, like the wiser man in the story, submit, bear the just punishment,&nbsp; try to be better for it; and though the scar would remain, it might&nbsp; serve as a reminder of a battle not wholly lost, since he had saved his&nbsp; soul though innocence was gone? Then he would dare go home, perhaps,&nbsp; confess, and find fresh strength in the pity and consolation of those&nbsp; who never gave him up.&nbsp; &nbsp; Good and evil fought for Dan that night as did the angel and the devil&nbsp; for Sintram, and it was hard to tell whether lawless nature or loving&nbsp; heart would conquer. Remorse and resentment, shame and sorrow, pride and&nbsp; passion, made a battle-field of that narrow cell, and the poor fellow&nbsp; felt as if he had fiercer enemies to fight now than any he had met in&nbsp; all his wanderings. A little thing turned the scale, as it so often does&nbsp; in these mysterious hearts of ours, and a touch of sympathy helped Dan&nbsp; decide the course which would bless or ban his life.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the dark hour before the dawn, as he lay wakeful on his bed, a ray&nbsp; of light shone through the bars, the bolts turned softly, and a man came&nbsp; in. It was the good chaplain, led by the same instinct that brings a&nbsp; mother to her sick child<U+2019>s pillow; for long experience as nurse of souls&nbsp; had taught him to see the signs of hope in the hard faces about him,&nbsp; and to know when the moment came for a helpful word and the cordial&nbsp; of sincere prayer that brings such comfort and healing to tried and&nbsp; troubled hearts. He had been to Dan before at unexpected hours, but&nbsp; always found him sullen, indifferent, or rebellious, and had gone away&nbsp; to patiently bide his time. Now it had come; a look of relief was in the&nbsp; prisoner<U+2019>s face as the light shone on it, and the sound of a human&nbsp; voice was strangely comfortable after listening to the whispers of&nbsp; the passions, doubts, and fears which had haunted the cell for hours,&nbsp; dismaying Dan by their power, and showing him how much he needed help to&nbsp; fight the good fight, since he had no armour of his own.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Kent, poor Mason has gone. He left a message for you, and I felt&nbsp; impelled to come and give it now, because I think you were touched by&nbsp; what we heard today, and in need of the help Mason tried to give you,<U+2019>&nbsp; said the chaplain, taking the one seat and fixing his kind eyes on the&nbsp; grim figure in the bed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thank you, sir, I<U+2019>d like to hear it,<U+2019> was all Dan<U+2019>s answer; but he&nbsp; forgot himself in pity for the poor fellow dead in prison, with no last&nbsp; look at wife or child.&nbsp; &nbsp; He went suddenly, but remembered you, and begged me to say these words:&nbsp; <U+201C>Tell him not to do it, but to hold on, do his best, and when his time&nbsp; is out go right to Mary, and she<U+2019>ll make him welcome for my sake. He<U+2019>s&nbsp; got no friends in these parts and will feel lonesome, but a woman<U+2019>s&nbsp; always safe and comfortable when a fellow<U+2019>s down on his luck. Give him&nbsp; my love and good-bye for he was kind to me, and God will bless him for&nbsp; it.<U+201D> Then he died quietly, and tomorrow will go home with God<U+2019>s pardon,&nbsp; since man<U+2019>s came too late.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan said nothing, but laid his arm across his face and lay quite still.&nbsp; Seeing that the pathetic little message had done its work even better&nbsp; than he hoped, the chaplain went on, unconscious how soothing his&nbsp; paternal voice was to the poor prisoner who longed to <U+2018>go home<U+2019>, but&nbsp; felt he had forfeited the right.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I hope you won<U+2019>t disappoint this humble friend whose last thought was&nbsp; for you. I know that there is trouble brewing, and fear that you may be&nbsp; tempted to lend a hand on the wrong side. Don<U+2019>t do it, for the plot will&nbsp; not succeed--it never does--and it would be a pity to spoil your record&nbsp; which is fair so far. Keep up your courage, my son, and go out at the&nbsp; year<U+2019>s end better, not worse, for this hard experience. Remember a&nbsp; grateful woman waits to welcome and thank you if you have no friends of&nbsp; your own; if you have, do your best for their sake, and let us ask God&nbsp; to help you as He only can.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Then waiting for no answer the good man prayed heartily, and Dan&nbsp; listened as he never had before; for the lonely hour, the dying message,&nbsp; the sudden uprising of his better self, made it seem as if some kind&nbsp; angel had come to save and comfort him. After that night there was a&nbsp; change in Dan, though no one knew it but the chaplain; for to all the&nbsp; rest he was the same silent, stern, unsocial fellow as before, and&nbsp; turning his back on the bad and the good alike, found his only pleasure&nbsp; in the books his friend brought him. Slowly, as the steadfast drop wears&nbsp; away the rock, the patient kindness of this man won Dan<U+2019>s confidence,&nbsp; and led by him he began to climb out of the Valley of Humiliation&nbsp; towards the mountains, whence, through the clouds, one can catch&nbsp; glimpses of the Celestial City whither all true pilgrims sooner or&nbsp; later turn their wistful eyes and stumbling feet. There were many&nbsp; back-slidings, many struggles with Giant Despair and fiery Apollyon,&nbsp; many heavy hours when life did not seem worth living and Mason<U+2019>s escape&nbsp; the only hope. But through all, the grasp of a friendly hand, the sound&nbsp; of a brother<U+2019>s voice, the unquenchable desire to atone for the past by a&nbsp; better future, and win the right to see home again, kept poor Dan to his&nbsp; great task as the old year drew to its end, and the new waited to turn&nbsp; another leaf in the book whose hardest lesson he was learning now.&nbsp; &nbsp; At Christmas he yearned so for Plumfield that he devised a way to send a&nbsp; word of greeting to cheer their anxious hearts, and comfort his own. He&nbsp; wrote to Mary Mason, who lived in another State, asking her to mail the&nbsp; letter he enclosed. In it he merely said he was well and busy, had given&nbsp; up the farm, and had other plans which he would tell later; would not&nbsp; be home before autumn probably, nor write often, but was all right, and&nbsp; sent love and merry Christmas to everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then he took up his solitary life again, and tried to pay his forfeit&nbsp; manfully.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 13. NAT<U+2019>S NEW YEAR&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t expect to hear from Emil yet, and Nat writes regularly, but&nbsp; where is Dan? Only two or three postals since he went. Such an energetic&nbsp; fellow as he is could buy up all the farms in Kansas by this time,<U+2019> said&nbsp; Mrs Jo one morning when the mail came in and no card or envelope bore&nbsp; Dan<U+2019>s dashing hand.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He never writes often, you know, but does his work and then comes&nbsp; home. Months and years seem to mean little to him, and he is probably&nbsp; prospecting in the wilderness, forgetful of time,<U+2019> answered Mr Bhaer,&nbsp; deep in one of Nat<U+2019>s long letters from Leipzig.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But he promised he would let me know how he got on, and Dan keeps his&nbsp; word if he can. I<U+2019>m afraid something has happened to him<U+2019>; and Mrs Jo&nbsp; comforted herself by patting Don<U+2019>s head, as he came at the sound of his&nbsp; master<U+2019>s name to look at her with eyes almost human in their wistful&nbsp; intelligence.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t worry, Mum dear, nothing ever happens to the old fellow. He<U+2019>ll&nbsp; turn up all right, and come stalking in some day with a gold-mine in one&nbsp; pocket and a prairie in the other, as jolly as a grig,<U+2019> said Ted, who&nbsp; was in no haste to deliver Octoo to her rightful owner.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Perhaps he has gone to Montana and given up the farm plan. He seemed to&nbsp; like Indians best, I thought<U+2019>; and Rob went to help his mother with her&nbsp; pile of letters and his cheerful suggestions.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I hope so, it would suit him best. But I am sure he would have told us&nbsp; his change of plan and sent for some money to work with. No, I feel in&nbsp; my prophetic bones that something is wrong,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, looking as&nbsp; solemn as Fate in a breakfast-cap.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Then we shall hear; ill news always travels fast. Don<U+2019>t borrow trouble,&nbsp; Jo, but hear how well Nat is getting on. I<U+2019>d no idea the boy would care&nbsp; for anything but music. My good friend Baumgarten has launched him well,&nbsp; and it will do him good if he lose not his head. A good lad, but new to&nbsp; the world, and Leipzig is full of snares for the unwary. Gott be with&nbsp; him!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Professor read Nat<U+2019>s enthusiastic account of certain literary&nbsp; and musical parties he had been to, the splendours of the opera, the&nbsp; kindness of his new friends, the delight of studying under such a master&nbsp; as Bergmann, his hopes of rapid gain, and his great gratitude to those&nbsp; who had opened this enchanted world to him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That, now, is satisfactory and comfortable. I felt that Nat had&nbsp; unsuspected power in him before he went away; he was so manly and full&nbsp; of excellent plans,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, in a satisfied tone.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We shall see. He will doubtless get his lesson and be the better for&nbsp; it. That comes to us all in our young days. I hope it will not be too&nbsp; hard for our good Jungling,<U+2019> answered the Professor, with a wise smile,&nbsp; remembering his own student life in Germany.&nbsp; &nbsp; He was right; and Nat was already getting his lesson in life with a&nbsp; rapidity which would have astonished his friends at home. The manliness&nbsp; over which Mrs Jo rejoiced was developing in unexpected ways, and quiet&nbsp; Nat had plunged into the more harmless dissipations of the gay city&nbsp; with all the ardour of an inexperienced youth taking his first sip of&nbsp; pleasure. The entire freedom and sense of independence was delicious,&nbsp; for many benefits began to burden him, and he longed to stand on his&nbsp; own legs and make his own way. No one knew his past here; and with a&nbsp; well-stocked wardrobe, a handsome sum at his banker<U+2019>s, and the best&nbsp; teacher in Leipzig, he made his debut as a musical young gentleman,&nbsp; presented by the much-respected Professor Bhaer and the wealthy Mr&nbsp; Laurence, who had many friends glad to throw open their houses to&nbsp; his protege. Thanks to these introductions, his fluent German, modest&nbsp; manners, and undeniable talent, the stranger was cordially welcomed, and&nbsp; launched at once into a circle which many an ambitious young man strove&nbsp; in vain to enter.&nbsp; &nbsp; All this rather turned Nat<U+2019>s head; and as he sat in the brilliant&nbsp; opera-house, chatted among the ladies at some select coffee-party, or&nbsp; whisked an eminent professor<U+2019>s amiable daughter down the room, trying to&nbsp; imagine she was Daisy, he often asked himself if this gay fellow could&nbsp; be the poor homeless little Street musician who once stood waiting in&nbsp; the rain at the gates of Plumfield. His heart was true, his impulses&nbsp; good, and his ambitions high; but the weak side of his nature came&nbsp; uppermost here; vanity led him astray, pleasure intoxicated him, and for&nbsp; a time he forgot everything but the delights of this new and charming&nbsp; life. Without meaning to deceive, he allowed people to imagine him a&nbsp; youth of good family and prospects; he boasted a little of Mr Laurie<U+2019>s&nbsp; wealth and influence, of Professor Bhaer<U+2019>s eminence, and the flourishing&nbsp; college at which he himself had been educated. Mrs Jo was introduced to&nbsp; the sentimental Frauleins who read her books, and the charms and virtues&nbsp; of his own dear Madchen confided to sympathetic mammas. All these boyish&nbsp; boastings and innocent vanities were duly circulated among the&nbsp; gossips, and his importance much increased thereby, to his surprise and&nbsp; gratification, as well as some shame.&nbsp; &nbsp; But they bore fruit that was bitter in the end; for, finding that he was&nbsp; considered one of the upper class, it very soon became impossible&nbsp; for him to live in the humble quarters he had chosen, or to lead the&nbsp; studious, quiet life planned for him. He met other students, young&nbsp; officers, and gay fellows of all sorts, and was flattered at being&nbsp; welcomed among them; though it was a costly pleasure, and often left&nbsp; a thorn of regret to vex his honest conscience. He was tempted to take&nbsp; better rooms in a more fashionable street, leaving good Frau Tetzel to&nbsp; lament his loss, and his artist neighbour, Fraulein Vogelstein, to shake&nbsp; her grey ringlets and predict his return, a sadder and a wiser man.&nbsp; &nbsp; The sum placed at his disposal for expenses and such simple pleasures&nbsp; as his busy life could command seemed a fortune to Nat, though it was&nbsp; smaller than generous Mr Laurie first proposed. Professor Bhaer wisely&nbsp; counselled prudence, as Nat was unused to the care of money, and the&nbsp; good man knew the temptations that a well-filled purse makes possible at&nbsp; this pleasure-loving age. So Nat enjoyed his handsome little apartment&nbsp; immensely, and insensibly let many unaccustomed luxuries creep in. He&nbsp; loved his music and never missed a lesson; but the hours he should&nbsp; have spent in patient practice were too often wasted at theatre, ball,&nbsp; beer-garden, or club--doing no harm beyond that waste of precious time,&nbsp; and money not his own; for he had no vices, and took his recreation like&nbsp; a gentleman, so far. But slowly a change for the worse was beginning to&nbsp; show itself, and he felt it. These first steps along the flowery road&nbsp; were downward, not upward; and the constant sense of disloyalty which&nbsp; soon began to haunt him made Nat feel, in the few quiet hours he gave&nbsp; himself, that all was not well with him, spite of the happy whirl in&nbsp; which he lived.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Another month, and then I will be steady,<U+2019> he said more than once,&nbsp; trying to excuse the delay by the fact that all was new to him, that his&nbsp; friends at home wished him to be happy, and that society was giving him&nbsp; the polish he needed. But as each month slipped away it grew harder to&nbsp; escape; he was inevitably drawn on, and it was so easy to drift with&nbsp; the tide that he deferred the evil day as long as possible. Winter&nbsp; festivities followed the more wholesome summer pleasures, and Nat found&nbsp; them more costly; for the hospitable ladies expected some return from&nbsp; the stranger; and carriages, bouquets, theatre tickets, and all the&nbsp; little expenses a young man cannot escape at such times, told heavily&nbsp; on the purse which seemed bottomless at first. Taking Mr Laurie for&nbsp; his model, Nat became quite a gallant, and was universally liked; for&nbsp; through all the newly acquired airs and graces the genuine honesty&nbsp; and simplicity of his character plainly shone, winning confidence and&nbsp; affection from all who knew him.&nbsp; &nbsp; Among these was a certain amiable old lady with a musical&nbsp; daughter--well-born but poor, and very anxious to marry the aforesaid&nbsp; daughter to some wealthy man. Nat<U+2019>s little fictions concerning his&nbsp; prospects and friends charmed the gnadige Frau as much as his music and&nbsp; devoted manners did the sentimental Minna. Their quiet parlour seemed&nbsp; homelike and restful to Nat, when tired of gayer scenes; and the&nbsp; motherly interest of the elder lady was sweet and comfortable to him;&nbsp; while the tender blue eyes of the pretty girl were always so full of&nbsp; welcome when he came, of regret when he left, and of admiration when&nbsp; he played to her, that he found it impossible to keep away from this&nbsp; attractive spot. He meant no harm, and feared no danger, having confided&nbsp; to the Frau Mamma that he was betrothed; so he continued to call, little&nbsp; dreaming what ambitious hopes the old lady cherished, nor the peril&nbsp; there was in receiving the adoration of a romantic German girl, till it&nbsp; was too late to spare her pain and himself great regret.&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course some inkling of these new and agreeable experiences got into&nbsp; the voluminous letters he never was too gay, too busy, or too tired&nbsp; to write each week; and while Daisy rejoiced over his happiness and&nbsp; success, and the boys laughed at the idea of <U+2018>old Chirper coming out as&nbsp; a society man<U+2019>, the elders looked sober, and said among themselves:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He is going too fast; he must have a word of warning, or trouble may&nbsp; come.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; But Mr Laurie said: <U+2018>Oh, let him have his fling; he<U+2019>s been dependent and&nbsp; repressed long enough. He can<U+2019>t go far with the money he has, and I<U+2019>ve&nbsp; no fear of his getting into debt. He<U+2019>s too timid and too honest to be&nbsp; reckless. It is his first taste of freedom; let him enjoy it, and he<U+2019>ll&nbsp; work the better by and by; I know--and I<U+2019>m sure I<U+2019>m right.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; So the warnings were very gentle, and the good people waited anxiously&nbsp; to hear more of hard study, and less of <U+2018>splendid times<U+2019>. Daisy&nbsp; sometimes wondered, with a pang of her faithful heart, if one of the&nbsp; charming Minnas, Hildegardes, and Lottchens mentioned were not stealing&nbsp; her Nat away from her; but she never asked, always wrote calmly and&nbsp; cheerfully, and looked in vain for any hint of change in the letters&nbsp; that were worn out with much reading.&nbsp; &nbsp; Month after month slipped away, till the holidays came with gifts, good&nbsp; wishes, and brilliant festivities. Nat expected to enjoy himself very&nbsp; much, and did at first; for a German Christmas is a spectacle worth&nbsp; seeing. But he paid dearly for the abandon with which he threw himself&nbsp; into the gaieties of that memorable week; and on New Year<U+2019>s Day the&nbsp; reckoning came. It seemed as if some malicious fairy had prepared the&nbsp; surprises that arrived, so unwelcome were they, so magical the change&nbsp; they wrought, turning his happy world into a scene of desolation and&nbsp; despair as suddenly as a transformation at the pantomime.&nbsp; &nbsp; The first came in the morning when, duly armed with costly bouquets&nbsp; and bon-bons, he went to thank Minna and her mother for the braces&nbsp; embroidered with forget-me-nots and the silk socks knit by the old&nbsp; lady<U+2019>s nimble fingers, which he had found upon his table that day. The&nbsp; Frau Mamma received him graciously; but when he asked for the daughter&nbsp; the good lady frankly demanded what his intentions were, adding that&nbsp; certain gossip which had reached her ear made it necessary for him&nbsp; to declare himself or come no more, as Minna<U+2019>s peace must not be&nbsp; compromised.&nbsp; &nbsp; A more panic-stricken youth was seldom seen than Nat as he received this&nbsp; unexpected demand. He saw too late that his American style of gallantry&nbsp; had deceived the artless girl, and might be used with terrible effect&nbsp; by the artful mother, if she chose to do it. Nothing but the truth could&nbsp; save him, and he had the honour and honesty to tell it faithfully. A&nbsp; sad scene followed; for Nat was obliged to strip off his fictitious&nbsp; splendour, confess himself only a poor student, and humbly ask pardon&nbsp; for the thoughtless freedom with which he had enjoyed their too&nbsp; confiding hospitality. If he had any doubts of Frau Schomburg<U+2019>s motives&nbsp; and desires, they were speedily set at rest by the frankness with which&nbsp; she showed her disappointment, the vigour with which she scolded him,&nbsp; and the scorn with which she cast him off when her splendid castles in&nbsp; the air collapsed.&nbsp; &nbsp; The sincerity of Nat<U+2019>s penitence softened her a little and she consented&nbsp; to a farewell word with Minna, who had listened at the keyhole, and was&nbsp; produced drenched in tears, to fall on Nat<U+2019>s bosom, crying: <U+2018>Ah, thou&nbsp; dear one, never can I forget thee, though my heart is broken!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; This was worse than the scolding; for the stout lady also wept, and it&nbsp; was only after much German gush and twaddle that he escaped, feeling&nbsp; like another Werther; while the deserted Lotte consoled herself with the&nbsp; bonbons, her mother with the more valuable gifts.&nbsp; &nbsp; The second surprise arrived as he dined with Professor Baumgarten. His&nbsp; appetite had been effectually taken away by the scene of the morning,&nbsp; and his spirits received another damper when a fellow student cheerfully&nbsp; informed him that he was about to go to America, and should make it his&nbsp; agreeable duty to call on the <U+2018>lieber Herr Professor Bhaer<U+2019>, to tell&nbsp; him how gaily his protege was disporting himself at Leipzig. Nat<U+2019>s heart&nbsp; died within him as he imagined the effect these glowing tales would have&nbsp; at Plumfield--not that he had wilfully deceived them, but in his letters&nbsp; many things were left untold; and when Carlsen added, with a friendly&nbsp; wink, that he would merely hint at the coming betrothal of the fair&nbsp; Minna and his <U+2018>heart<U+2019>s friend<U+2019>, Nat found himself devoutly hoping that&nbsp; this other inconvenient heart<U+2019>s friend might go to the bottom of the sea&nbsp; before he reached Plumfield to blast all his hopes by these tales of a&nbsp; mis-spent winter. Collecting his wits, he cautioned Carlsen with what&nbsp; he flattered himself was Mephistophelian art, and gave him such confused&nbsp; directions that it would be a miracle if he ever found Professor Bhaer.&nbsp; But the dinner was spoilt for Nat, and he got away as soon as possible,&nbsp; to wander disconsolately about the streets, with no heart for the&nbsp; theatre or the supper he was to share with some gay comrades afterwards.&nbsp; He comforted himself a little by giving alms to sundry beggars, making&nbsp; two children happy with gilded gingerbread, and drinking a lonely glass&nbsp; of beer, in which he toasted his Daisy and wished himself a better year&nbsp; than the last had been.&nbsp; &nbsp; Going home at length, he found a third surprise awaiting him in the&nbsp; shower of bills which had descended upon him like a snowstorm, burying&nbsp; him in an avalanche of remorse, despair, and self-disgust. These bills&nbsp; were so many and so large that he was startled and dismayed; for, as&nbsp; Mr Bhaer wisely predicted, he knew little about the value of money.&nbsp; It would take every dollar at the bankers to pay them all at once, and&nbsp; leave him penniless for the next six months, unless he wrote home for&nbsp; more. He would rather starve than do that; and his first impulse was to&nbsp; seek help at the gaming-table, whither his new friends had often tempted&nbsp; him. But he had promised Mr Bhaer to resist what then had seemed an&nbsp; impossible temptation; and now he would not add another fault to the&nbsp; list already so long. Borrow he would not, nor beg. What could he do?&nbsp; For these appalling bills must be paid, and the lessons go on; or his&nbsp; journey was an ignominious failure. But he must live meantime. And how?&nbsp; Bowed down with remorse for the folly of these months, he saw too late&nbsp; whither he was drifting, and for hours paced up and down his pretty&nbsp; rooms, floundering in a Slough of Despond, with no helping hand to pull&nbsp; him out--at least he thought so till letters were brought in, and among&nbsp; fresh bills lay one well-worn envelope with an American stamp in the&nbsp; corner.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, how welcome it was! how eagerly he read the long pages full of&nbsp; affectionate wishes from all at home! For everyone had sent a line, and&nbsp; as each familiar name appeared, his eyes grew dimmer and dimmer till, as&nbsp; he read the last--<U+2018>God bless my boy! Mother Bhaer<U+2019>--he broke down; and&nbsp; laying his head on his arms, blistered the paper with a rain of tears&nbsp; that eased his heart and washed away the boyish sins that now lay so&nbsp; heavy on his conscience.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dear people, how they love and trust me! And how bitterly they would&nbsp; be disappointed if they knew what a fool I<U+2019>ve been! I<U+2019>ll fiddle in the&nbsp; streets again before I<U+2019>ll ask for help from them!<U+2019> cried Nat, brushing&nbsp; away the tears of which he was ashamed, although he felt the good they&nbsp; had done.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now he seemed to see more clearly what to do; for the helping hand had&nbsp; been stretched across the sea, and Love, the dear Evangelist, had&nbsp; lifted him out of the slough and shown him the narrow gate, beyond which&nbsp; deliverance lay. When the letter had been reread, and one corner where&nbsp; a daisy was painted, passionately kissed, Nat felt strong enough to face&nbsp; the worst and conquer it. Every bill should be paid, every salable thing&nbsp; of his own sold, these costly rooms given up; and once back with&nbsp; thrifty Frau Tetzel, he would find work of some sort by which to support&nbsp; himself, as many another student did. He must give up the new friends,&nbsp; turn his back on the gay life, cease to be a butterfly, and take his&nbsp; place among the grubs. It was the only honest thing to do, but very hard&nbsp; for the poor fellow to crush his little vanities, renounce the delights&nbsp; so dear to the young, own his folly, and step down from his pedestal to&nbsp; be pitied, laughed at, and forgotten.&nbsp; &nbsp; It took all Nat<U+2019>s pride and courage to do this, for his was a sensitive&nbsp; nature; esteem was very precious to him, failure very bitter, and&nbsp; nothing but the inborn contempt for meanness and deceit kept him from&nbsp; asking help or trying to hide his need by some dishonest device. As he&nbsp; sat alone that night, Mr Bhaer<U+2019>s words came back to him with curious&nbsp; clearness, and he saw himself a boy again at Plumfield, punishing his&nbsp; teacher as a lesson to himself, when timidity had made him lie.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He shall not suffer for me again, and I won<U+2019>t be a sneak if I am a&nbsp; fool. I<U+2019>ll go and tell Professor Baumgarten all about it and ask his&nbsp; advice. I<U+2019>d rather face a loaded cannon; but it must be done. Then I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; sell out, pay my debts, and go back where I belong. Better be an honest&nbsp; pauper than a jackdaw among peacocks<U+2019>; and Nat smiled in the midst of&nbsp; his trouble, as he looked about him at the little elegancies of his&nbsp; room, remembering what he came from.&nbsp; &nbsp; He kept his word manfully, and was much comforted to find that his&nbsp; experience was an old story to the professor, who approved his plan,&nbsp; thinking wisely that the discipline would be good for him, and was very&nbsp; kind in offering help and promising to keep the secret of his folly from&nbsp; his friend Bhaer till Nat had redeemed himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; The first week of the new year was spent by our prodigal in carrying out&nbsp; his plan with penitent dispatch, and his birthday found him alone in&nbsp; the little room high up at Frau Tetzel<U+2019>s, with nothing of his former&nbsp; splendour, but sundry unsalable keepsakes from the buxom maidens, who&nbsp; mourned his absence deeply. His male friends had ridiculed, pitied,&nbsp; and soon left him alone, with one or two exceptions, who offered their&nbsp; purses generously and promised to stand by him. He was lonely and&nbsp; heavy-hearted, and sat brooding over his small fire as he remembered the&nbsp; last New Year<U+2019>s Day at Plumfield, when at this hour he was dancing with&nbsp; his Daisy.&nbsp; &nbsp; A tap at the door roused him, and with a careless <U+2018>Herein<U+2019>, he waited&nbsp; to see who had climbed so far for his sake. It was the good Frau proudly&nbsp; bearing a tray, on which stood a bottle of wine and an astonishing&nbsp; cake bedecked with sugar-plums of every hue, and crowned with candles.&nbsp; Fraulein Vogelstein followed, embracing a blooming rose-tree, above&nbsp; which her grey curls waved and her friendly face beamed joyfully as she&nbsp; cried:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dear Herr Blak, we bring you greetings and a little gift or two in&nbsp; honour of this ever-to-be-remembered day. Best wishes! and may the new&nbsp; year bloom for you as beautifully as we your heart-warm friends desire.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, yes, in truth we do, dear Herr,<U+2019> added Frau Tetzel. <U+2018>Eat of this&nbsp; with-joy-made Kuchen, and drink to the health of the far-away beloved&nbsp; ones in the good wine.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Amused, yet touched by the kindness of the good souls, Nat thanked them&nbsp; both, and made them stay to enjoy the humble feast with him. This they&nbsp; gladly did, being motherly women full of pity for the dear youth, whose&nbsp; straits they knew, and having substantial help to offer, as well as kind&nbsp; words and creature comforts.&nbsp; &nbsp; Frau Tetzel, with some hesitation, mentioned a friend of hers who,&nbsp; forced by illness to leave his place in the orchestra of a second-rate&nbsp; theatre, would gladly offer it to Nat, if he could accept so humble a&nbsp; position. Blushing and toying with the roses like a shy girl, good old&nbsp; Vogelstein asked if in his leisure moments he could give English lessons&nbsp; in the young ladies<U+2019> school where she taught painting, adding that a&nbsp; small but certain salary would be paid him.&nbsp; &nbsp; Gratefully Nat accepted both offers, finding it less humiliating to be&nbsp; helped by women than by friends of his own sex. This work would support&nbsp; him in a frugal way, and certain musical drudgery promised by his master&nbsp; assured his own teaching. Delighted with the success of their little&nbsp; plot, these friendly neighbours left him with cheery words, warm&nbsp; hand-grasps, and faces beaming with feminine satisfaction at the hearty&nbsp; kiss Nat put on each faded cheek, as the only return he could make for&nbsp; all their helpful kindness.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was strange how much brighter the world looked after that; for hope&nbsp; was a better cordial than the wine, and good resolutions bloomed as&nbsp; freshly as the little rose-tree that filled the room with fragrance, as&nbsp; Nat woke the echoes with the dear old airs, finding now as always his&nbsp; best comforter in music, to whom henceforth he swore to be a more loyal&nbsp; subject.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 14. PLAYS AT PLUMFIELD&nbsp; &nbsp; As it is as impossible for the humble historian of the March family to&nbsp; write a story without theatricals in it as for our dear Miss Yonge to&nbsp; get on with less than twelve or fourteen children in her interesting&nbsp; tales, we will accept the fact, and at once cheer ourselves after&nbsp; the last afflicting events, by proceeding to the Christmas plays at&nbsp; Plumfield; for they influence the fate of several of our characters, and&nbsp; cannot well be skipped.&nbsp; &nbsp; When the college was built Mr Laurie added a charming little theatre&nbsp; which not only served for plays, but declamations, lectures, and&nbsp; concerts. The drop-curtain displayed Apollo with the Muses grouped about&nbsp; him; and as a compliment to the donor of the hall the artist had given&nbsp; the god a decided resemblance to our friend, which was considered&nbsp; a superb joke by everyone else. Home talent furnished stars, stock&nbsp; company, orchestra, and scene painter; and astonishing performances were&nbsp; given on this pretty little stage.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo had been trying for some time to produce a play which should&nbsp; be an improvement upon the adaptations from the French then in vogue,&nbsp; curious mixtures of fine toilettes, false sentiment, and feeble wit,&nbsp; with no touch of nature to redeem them. It was easy to plan plays full&nbsp; of noble speeches and thrilling situations, but very hard to write them;&nbsp; so she contented herself with a few scenes of humble life in which the&nbsp; comic and pathetic were mingled; and as she fitted her characters to&nbsp; her actors, she hoped the little venture would prove that truth and&nbsp; simplicity had not entirely lost their power to charm. Mr Laurie helped&nbsp; her, and they called themselves Beaumont and Fletcher, enjoying their&nbsp; joint labour very much; for Beaumont<U+2019>s knowledge of dramatic art was&nbsp; of great use in curbing Fletcher<U+2019>s too-aspiring pen, and they flattered&nbsp; themselves that they had produced a neat and effective bit of work as an&nbsp; experiment.&nbsp; &nbsp; All was ready now; and Christmas Day was much enlivened by last&nbsp; rehearsals, the panics of timid actors, the scramble for forgotten&nbsp; properties, and the decoration of the theatre. Evergreen and holly from&nbsp; the woods, blooming plants from the hothouse on Parnassus, and flags of&nbsp; all nations made it very gay that night in honour of the guests who were&nbsp; coming, chief among them, Miss Cameron, who kept her promise&nbsp; faithfully. The orchestra tuned their instruments with unusual care,&nbsp; the scene-shifters set their stage with lavish elegance, the prompter&nbsp; heroically took his seat in the stifling nook provided for him, and&nbsp; the actors dressed with trembling hands that dropped the pins, and&nbsp; perspiring brows whereon the powder wouldn<U+2019>t stick. Beaumont and&nbsp; Fletcher were everywhere, feeling that their literary reputation was&nbsp; at stake; for sundry friendly critics were invited, and reporters, like&nbsp; mosquitoes, cannot be excluded from any earthly scene, be it a great&nbsp; man<U+2019>s death-bed or a dime museum.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Has she come?<U+2019> was the question asked by every tongue behind the&nbsp; curtain; and when Tom, who played an old man, endangered his respectable&nbsp; legs among the footlights to peep, announced that he saw Miss Cameron<U+2019>s&nbsp; handsome head in the place of honour, a thrill pervaded the entire&nbsp; company, and Josie declared with an excited gasp that she was going to&nbsp; have stage fright for the first time in her life.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll shake you if you do,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, who was in such a wild state&nbsp; of dishevelment with her varied labours that she might have gone on as&nbsp; Madge Wildlife, without an additional rag or crazy elf-lock.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You<U+2019>ll have time to get your wits together while we do our piece. We&nbsp; are old stagers and calm as clocks,<U+2019> answered Demi, with a nod towards&nbsp; Alice, ready in her pretty dress and all her properties at hand.&nbsp; &nbsp; But both clocks were going rather faster than usual, as heightened&nbsp; colour, brilliant eyes, and a certain flutter under the laces and velvet&nbsp; coat betrayed. They were to open the entertainment with a gay little&nbsp; piece which they had played before and did remarkably well. Alice was&nbsp; a tall girl, with dark hair and eyes, and a face which intelligence,&nbsp; health, and a happy heart made beautiful. She was looking her best now,&nbsp; for the brocades, plumes, and powder of the Marquise became her stately&nbsp; figure; and Demi in his court suit, with sword, three-cornered hat, and&nbsp; white wig, made as gallant a Baron as one would wish to see. Josie was&nbsp; the maid, and looked her part to the life, being as pretty, pert,&nbsp; and inquisitive as any French soubrette. These three were all the&nbsp; characters; and the success of the piece depended on the spirit and&nbsp; skill with which the quickly changing moods of the quarrelsome lovers&nbsp; were given, their witty speeches made to tell, and by-play suited to the&nbsp; courtly period in which the scene was laid.&nbsp; &nbsp; Few would have recognized sober John and studious Alice in the dashing&nbsp; gentleman and coquettish lady, who kept the audience laughing at their&nbsp; caprices; while they enjoyed the brilliant costumes, and admired the&nbsp; ease and grace of the young actors. Josie was a prominent figure in the&nbsp; plot, as she listened at keyholes, peeped into notes, and popped in and&nbsp; out at all the most inopportune moments, with her nose in the air, her&nbsp; hands in her apron-pockets, and curiosity pervading her little figure&nbsp; from the topmost bow of her jaunty cap to the red heels of her slippers.&nbsp; All went smoothly; and the capricious Marquise, after tormenting the&nbsp; devoted Baron to her heart<U+2019>s content, owned herself conquered in the war&nbsp; of wits, and was just offering the hand he had fairly won, when a crash&nbsp; startled them, and a heavily decorated side-scene swayed forward, ready&nbsp; to fall upon Alice. Demi saw it and sprung before her to catch and hold&nbsp; it up, standing like a modern Samson with the wall of a house on his&nbsp; back. The danger was over in a moment, and he was about to utter his&nbsp; last speech, when the excited young scene-shifter, who had flown up a&nbsp; ladder to repair the damage, leaned over to whisper <U+2018>All right<U+2019>, and&nbsp; release Demi from his spread-eagle attitude: as he did so, a hammer&nbsp; slipped out of his pocket, to fall upon the upturned face below,&nbsp; inflicting a smart blow and literally knocking the Baron<U+2019>s part out of&nbsp; his head.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A quick curtain,<U+2019> robbed the audience of a pretty little scene not down&nbsp; on the bill; for the Marquise flew to staunch the blood with a cry of&nbsp; alarm: <U+2018>Oh! John, you are hurt! Lean on me<U+2019>--which John gladly did for a&nbsp; moment, being a trifle dazed yet quite able to enjoy the tender touch of&nbsp; the hands busied about him and the anxiety of the face so near his own;&nbsp; for both told him something which he would have considered cheaply won&nbsp; by a rain of hammers and the fall of the whole college on his head.&nbsp; &nbsp; Nan was on the spot in a moment with the case that never left her&nbsp; pocket; and the wound was neatly plastered up by the time Mrs Jo&nbsp; arrived, demanding tragically:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Is he too much hurt to go on again? If he is, my play is lost!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m all the fitter for it, Aunty; for here<U+2019>s a real instead of a&nbsp; painted wound. I<U+2019>ll be ready; don<U+2019>t worry about me.<U+2019> And catching up&nbsp; his wig, Demi was off, with only a very eloquent look of thanks to the&nbsp; Marquise, who had spoilt her gloves for his sake, but did not seem to&nbsp; mind it at all, though they reached above her elbows, and were most&nbsp; expensive.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How are your nerves, Fletcher?<U+2019> asked Mr Laurie as they stood together&nbsp; during the breathless minute before the last bell rings.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>About as calm as yours, Beaumont,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, gesticulating&nbsp; wildly to Mrs Meg to set her cap straight.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bear up, partner! I<U+2019>ll stand by you whatever comes!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I feel that it ought to go; for, though it<U+2019>s a mere trifle, a good deal&nbsp; of honest work and truth have gone into it. Doesn<U+2019>t Meg look the picture&nbsp; of a dear old country woman?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; She certainly did, as she sat in the farmhouse kitchen by a cheery fire,&nbsp; rocking a cradle and darning stockings, as if she had done nothing else&nbsp; all her life. Grey hair, skilfully drawn lines on the forehead, and a&nbsp; plain gown, with cap, little shawl, and check apron, changed her into a&nbsp; comfortable, motherly creature who found favour the moment the curtain&nbsp; went up and discovered her rocking, darning, and crooning an old song.&nbsp; In a short soliloquy about Sam, her boy, who wanted to enlist;&nbsp; Dolly, her discontented little daughter, who longed for city ease and&nbsp; pleasures; and poor <U+2018>Elizy<U+2019>, who had married badly, and came home to&nbsp; die, bequeathing her baby to her mother, lest its bad father should&nbsp; claim it, the little story was very simply opened, and made effective&nbsp; by the real boiling of the kettle on the crane, the ticking of a tall&nbsp; clock, and the appearance of a pair of blue worsted shoes which&nbsp; waved fitfully in the air to the soft babble of a baby<U+2019>s voice. Those&nbsp; shapeless little shoes won the first applause; and Mr Laurie, forgetting&nbsp; elegance in satisfaction, whispered to his coadjutor:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I thought the baby would fetch them!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If the dear thing won<U+2019>t squall in the wrong place, we are saved. But&nbsp; it is risky. Be ready to catch it if all Meg<U+2019>s cuddlings prove in vain,<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Mrs Jo, adding, with a clutch at Mr Laurie<U+2019>s arm as a haggard&nbsp; face appeared at the window:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Here<U+2019>s Demi! I hope no one will recognize him when he comes on as the&nbsp; son. I<U+2019>ll never forgive you for not doing the villain yourself.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Can<U+2019>t run the thing and act too. He<U+2019>s capitally made up, and likes a&nbsp; bit of melodrama.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This scene ought to have come later; but I wanted to show that the&nbsp; mother was the heroine as soon as possible. I<U+2019>m tired of love-sick girls&nbsp; and runaway wives. We<U+2019>ll prove that there<U+2019>s romance in old women also.&nbsp; Now he<U+2019>s coming!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; And in slouched a degraded-looking man, shabby, unshaven, and evil-eyed,&nbsp; trying to assume a masterful air as he dismayed the tranquil old woman&nbsp; by demanding his child. A powerful scene followed; and Mrs Meg surprised&nbsp; even those who knew her best by the homely dignity with which she at&nbsp; first met the man she dreaded; then, as he brutally pressed his claim,&nbsp; she pleaded with trembling voice and hands to keep the little creature&nbsp; she had promised the dying mother to protect; and when he turned to&nbsp; take it by force, quite a thrill went through the house as the old woman&nbsp; sprung to snatch it from the cradle, and holding it close, defied him in&nbsp; God<U+2019>s name to tear it from that sacred refuge. It was really well done;&nbsp; and the round of applause that greeted the fine tableau of the indignant&nbsp; old woman, the rosy, blinking baby clinging to her neck, and the daunted&nbsp; man who dared not execute his evil purpose with such a defender for&nbsp; helpless innocence, told the excited authors that their first scene was&nbsp; a hit.&nbsp; &nbsp; The second was quieter, and introduced Josie as a bonny country lass&nbsp; setting the supper-table in a bad humour. The pettish way in which she&nbsp; slapped down the plates, hustled the cups, and cut the big brown loaf,&nbsp; as she related her girlish trials and ambitions, was capital. Mrs Jo&nbsp; kept her eye on Miss Cameron, and saw her nod approval several times at&nbsp; some natural tone or gesture, some good bit of by-play or a quick change&nbsp; of expression in the young face, which was as variable as an April day.&nbsp; Her struggle with the toasting-fork made much merriment; so did her&nbsp; contempt for the brown sugar, and the relish with which she sweetened&nbsp; her irksome duties by eating it; and when she sat, like Cinderella, on&nbsp; the hearth, tearfully watching the flames dance on the homely room, a&nbsp; girlish voice was heard to exclaim impulsively:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Poor little thing! she ought to have some fun!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The old woman enters; and mother and daughter have a pretty scene, in&nbsp; which the latter coaxes and threatens, kisses and cries, till she wins&nbsp; the reluctant consent of the former to visit a rich relation in the&nbsp; city; and from being a little thunder-cloud Dolly becomes bewitchingly&nbsp; gay and good, as soon as her wilful wish is granted. The poor old soul&nbsp; has hardly recovered from this trial when the son enters, in army&nbsp; blue, tells he has enlisted and must go. That is a hard blow; but the&nbsp; patriotic mother bears it well, and not till the thoughtless young folks&nbsp; have hastened away to tell their good news elsewhere does she break&nbsp; down. Then the country kitchen becomes pathetic as the old mother sits&nbsp; alone mourning over her children, till the grey head is hidden in the&nbsp; hands as she kneels down by the cradle to weep and pray, with only Baby&nbsp; to comfort her fond and faithful heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sniffs were audible all through the latter part of this scene; and&nbsp; when the curtain fell, people were so busy wiping their eyes that for&nbsp; a moment they forgot to applaud. That silent moment was more flattering&nbsp; than noise; and as Mrs Jo wiped the real tears off her sister<U+2019>s&nbsp; face, she said as solemnly as an unconscious dab of rouge on her nose&nbsp; permitted:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Meg, you have saved my play! Oh, why aren<U+2019>t you a real actress, and I a&nbsp; real playwright?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t gush now, dear, but help me dress Josie; she<U+2019>s in such a quiver&nbsp; of excitement, I can<U+2019>t manage her, and this is her best scene, you&nbsp; know.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; So it was; for her aunt had written it especially for her, and little Jo&nbsp; was happy in a gorgeous dress, with a train long enough to satisfy her&nbsp; wildest dreams. The rich relation<U+2019>s parlour was in festival array, and&nbsp; the country cousin sails in, looking back at her sweeping flounces with&nbsp; such artless rapture that no one had the heart to laugh at the pretty&nbsp; jay in borrowed plumes. She has confidences with herself in the mirror,&nbsp; from which it is made evident that she had discovered all is not gold&nbsp; that glitters, and has found greater temptations than those a girlish&nbsp; love of pleasure, luxury, and flattery bring her. She is sought by a&nbsp; rich lover; but her honest heart resists the allurements he offers,&nbsp; and in its innocent perplexity wishes <U+2018>mother<U+2019> was there to comfort and&nbsp; counsel.&nbsp; &nbsp; A gay little dance, in which Dora, Nan, Bess, and several of the boys&nbsp; took part, made a good background for the humble figure of the old woman&nbsp; in her widow<U+2019>s bonnet, rusty shawl, big umbrella, and basket. Her naive&nbsp; astonishment, as she surveys the spectacle, feels the curtains, and&nbsp; smooths her old gloves during the moment she remains unseen, was very&nbsp; good; but Josie<U+2019>s unaffected start when she sees her, and the cry:&nbsp; <U+2018>Why, there<U+2019>s mother!<U+2019> was such a hearty little bit of nature, it hardly&nbsp; needed the impatient tripping over her train as she ran into the arms&nbsp; that seemed now to be her nearest refuge.&nbsp; &nbsp; The lover plays his part; and ripples of merriment greeted the old&nbsp; woman<U+2019>s searching questions and blunt answers during the interview which&nbsp; shows the girl how shallow his love is, and how near she had been to&nbsp; ruining her life as bitterly as poor <U+2018>Elizy<U+2019> did. She gives her answer&nbsp; frankly, and when they are alone, looks from her own bedizened self&nbsp; to the shabby dress, work-worn hands, and tender face, crying with a&nbsp; repentant sob and kiss: <U+2018>Take me home, mother, and keep me safe. I<U+2019>ve&nbsp; had enough of this!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That will do you good, Maria; don<U+2019>t forget it,<U+2019> said one lady to her&nbsp; daughter as the curtain went down; and the girl answered: <U+2018>Well, I<U+2019>m&nbsp; sure I don<U+2019>t see why it<U+2019>s touching; but it is,<U+2019> as she spread her lace&nbsp; handkerchief to dry.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom and Nan came out strong in the next scene; for it was a ward in&nbsp; an army hospital, and surgeon and nurse went from bed to bed, feeling&nbsp; pulses, administering doses, and hearing complaints with an energy and&nbsp; gravity which convulsed the audience. The tragic element, never far from&nbsp; the comic at such times and places, came in when, while they bandaged&nbsp; an arm, the doctor told the nurse about an old woman who was searching&nbsp; through the hospital for her son, after days and nights on battlefields,&nbsp; through ambulances, and among scenes which would have killed most women.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>She will be here directly, and I dread her coming, for I<U+2019>m afraid the&nbsp; poor lad who has just gone is her boy. I<U+2019>d rather face a cannon than&nbsp; these brave women, with their hope and courage and great sorrow,<U+2019> says&nbsp; the surgeon.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ah, these poor mothers break my heart!<U+2019> adds the nurse, wiping her eyes&nbsp; on her big apron; and with the words Mrs Meg came in.&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the same dress, the basket and umbrella, the rustic speech,&nbsp; the simple manners; but all were made pathetic by the terrible&nbsp; experience which had changed the tranquil old woman to that haggard&nbsp; figure with wild eyes, dusty feet, trembling hands, and an expression of&nbsp; mingled anguish, resolution, and despair which gave the homely figure&nbsp; a tragic dignity and power that touched all hearts. A few broken words&nbsp; told the story of her vain search, and then the sad quest began again.&nbsp; People held their breath as, led by the nurse, she went from bed to&nbsp; bed, showing in her face the alternations of hope, dread, and bitter&nbsp; disappointment as each was passed. On a narrow cot was a long figure&nbsp; covered with a sheet, and here she paused to lay one hand on her heart&nbsp; and one on her eyes, as if to gather courage to look at the nameless&nbsp; dead. Then she drew down the sheet, gave a long shivering sigh of&nbsp; relief, saying softly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not my son, thank God! but some mother<U+2019>s boy.<U+2019> And stooping down, she&nbsp; kissed the cold forehead tenderly.&nbsp; &nbsp; Somebody sobbed there, and Miss Cameron shook two tears out of her eyes,&nbsp; anxious to lose no look or gesture as the poor soul, nearly spent with&nbsp; the long strain, struggled on down the long line. But her search was&nbsp; happily ended for, as if her voice had roused him from his feverish&nbsp; sleep, a gaunt, wild-eyed man sat up in his bed, and stretching his arms&nbsp; to her, cried in a voice that echoed through the room:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mother, mother! I knew you<U+2019>d come to me!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; She did go to him, with a cry of love and joy that thrilled every&nbsp; listener, as she gathered him in her arms with the tears and prayers and&nbsp; blessing such as only a fond and faithful old mother could give.&nbsp; &nbsp; The last scene was a cheerful contrast to this; for the country kitchen&nbsp; was bright with Christmas cheer, the wounded hero, with black patch and&nbsp; crutches well displayed, sat by the fire in the old chair whose familiar&nbsp; creak was soothing to his ear; pretty Dolly was stirring about, gaily&nbsp; trimming dresser, settle, high chimney-piece, and old-fashioned cradle&nbsp; with mistletoe and holly; while the mother rested beside her son, with&nbsp; that blessed baby on her knee. Refreshed by a nap and nourishment, this&nbsp; young actor now covered himself with glory by his ecstatic prancings,&nbsp; incoherent remarks to the audience, and vain attempts to get to the&nbsp; footlights, as he blinked approvingly at these brilliant toys. It was&nbsp; good to see Mrs Meg pat him on the back, cuddle the fat legs out of&nbsp; sight, and appease his vain longings with a lump of sugar, till Baby&nbsp; embraced her with a grateful ardour that brought him a round of applause&nbsp; all for his little self.&nbsp; &nbsp; A sound of singing outside disturbs the happy family, and, after a carol&nbsp; in the snowy moonlight, a flock of neighbours troop in with Christmas&nbsp; gifts and greetings. Much by-play made this a lively picture; for Sam<U+2019>s&nbsp; sweetheart hovered round him with a tenderness the Marquise did not&nbsp; show the Baron; and Dolly had a pretty bit under the mistletoe with her&nbsp; rustic adorer, who looked so like Ham Peggotty in his cowhide boots,&nbsp; rough jacket, and dark beard and wig, that no one would have recognized&nbsp; Ted but for the long legs, which no extent of leather could disguise. It&nbsp; ended with a homely feast, brought by the guests; and as they sat round&nbsp; the table covered with doughnuts and cheese, pumpkin-pie, and other&nbsp; delicacies, Sam rises on his crutches to propose the first toast, and&nbsp; holding up his mug of cider, says, with a salute, and a choke in his&nbsp; voice: <U+2018>Mother, God bless her!<U+2019> All drink it standing, Dolly with her&nbsp; arm round the old woman<U+2019>s neck, as she hides her happy tears on her&nbsp; daughter<U+2019>s breast; while the irrepressible baby beat rapturously on the&nbsp; table with a spoon, and crowed audibly as the curtain went down.&nbsp; &nbsp; They had it up again in a jiffy to get a last look at the group about&nbsp; that central figure, which was showered with bouquets, to the great&nbsp; delight of the infant Roscius; till a fat rosebud hit him on the nose,&nbsp; and produced the much-dreaded squall, which, fortunately, only added to&nbsp; the fun at that moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, that will do for a beginning,<U+2019> said Beaumont, with a sigh of&nbsp; relief, as the curtain descended for the last time, and the actors&nbsp; scattered to dress for the closing piece.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>As an experiment, it is a success. Now we can venture to begin our&nbsp; great American drama,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, full of satisfaction and grand&nbsp; ideas for the famous play--which, we may add, she did not write that&nbsp; year, owing to various dramatic events in her own family.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Owlsdark Marbles closed the entertainment, and, being something new,&nbsp; proved amusing to this very indulgent audience. The gods and goddesses&nbsp; on Parnassus were displayed in full conclave; and, thanks to Mrs Amy<U+2019>s&nbsp; skill in draping and posing, the white wigs and cotton-flannel robes&nbsp; were classically correct and graceful, though sundry modern additions&nbsp; somewhat marred the effect, while adding point to the showman<U+2019>s learned&nbsp; remarks. Mr Laurie was Professor Owlsdark in cap and gown; and, after&nbsp; a high-flown introduction, he proceeded to exhibit and explain his&nbsp; marbles. The first figure was a stately Minerva; but a second glance&nbsp; produced a laugh, for the words <U+2018>Women<U+2019>s Rights<U+2019> adorned her shield, a&nbsp; scroll bearing the motto <U+2018>Vote early and often<U+2019> hung from the beak of&nbsp; the owl perched on her lance, and a tiny pestle and mortar ornamented&nbsp; her helmet. Attention was drawn to the firm mouth, the piercing eye, the&nbsp; awe-inspiring brow, of the strong-minded woman of antiquity, and some&nbsp; scathing remarks made upon the degeneracy of her modern sisters who&nbsp; failed to do their duty. Mercury came next, and was very fine in his&nbsp; airy attitude, though the winged legs quivered as if it was difficult to&nbsp; keep the lively god in his place. His restless nature was dilated upon,&nbsp; his mischievous freaks alluded to, and a very bad character given to&nbsp; the immortal messenger-boy; which delighted his friends and caused&nbsp; the marble nose of the victim to curl visibly with scorn when derisive&nbsp; applause greeted a particularly hard hit. A charming little Hebe stood&nbsp; next, pouring nectar from a silver teapot into a blue china tea-cup. She&nbsp; also pointed a moral; for the Professor explained that the nectar of old&nbsp; was the beverage which cheers but does not inebriate, and regretted that&nbsp; the excessive devotion of American women to this classic brew proved so&nbsp; harmful, owing to the great development of brain their culture produced.&nbsp; A touch at modern servants, in contrast to this accomplished table-girl,&nbsp; made the statue<U+2019>s cheeks glow under the chalk, and brought her a hearty&nbsp; round as the audience recognized Dolly and the smart soubrette.&nbsp; &nbsp; Jove in all his majesty followed, as he and his wife occupied the&nbsp; central pedestals in the half-circle of immortals. A splendid Jupiter,&nbsp; with hair well set up off the fine brow, ambrosial beard, silver&nbsp; thunderbolts in one hand, and a well-worn ferule in the other. A&nbsp; large stuffed eagle from the museum stood at his feet; and the benign&nbsp; expression of his august countenance showed that he was in a good&nbsp; humour--as well he might be, for he was paid some handsome compliments&nbsp; upon his wise rule, the peaceful state of his kingdom, and the brood&nbsp; of all-accomplished Pallases that yearly issued from his mighty brain.&nbsp; Cheers greeted this and other pleasant words, and caused the thunderer&nbsp; to bow his thanks; for <U+2018>Jove nods<U+2019>, as everyone knows, and flattery wins&nbsp; the heart of gods and men.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Juno, with her peacocks, darning-needle, pen, and cooking-spoon, did&nbsp; not get off so easily; for the Professor was down on her with all manner&nbsp; of mirth-provoking accusations, criticisms, and insults even. He alluded&nbsp; to her domestic infelicity, her meddlesome disposition, sharp tongue,&nbsp; bad temper, and jealousy, closing, however, with a tribute to her&nbsp; skill in caring for the wounds and settling the quarrels of belligerent&nbsp; heroes, as well as her love for youths in Olympus and on earth. Gales of&nbsp; laughter greeted these hits, varied by hisses from some indignant boys,&nbsp; who would not bear, even in joke, any disrespect to dear Mother Bhaer,&nbsp; who, however, enjoyed it all immensely, as the twinkle in her eye and&nbsp; the irrepressible pucker of her lips betrayed.&nbsp; &nbsp; A jolly Bacchus astride of his cask took Vulcan<U+2019>s place, and appeared to&nbsp; be very comfortable with a beer-mug in one hand, a champagne bottle in&nbsp; the other, and a garland of grapes on his curly head. He was the text&nbsp; of a short temperance lecture, aimed directly at a row of smart young&nbsp; gentlemen who lined the walls of the auditorium. George Cole was seen&nbsp; to dodge behind a pillar at one point, Dolly nudged his neighbour at&nbsp; another, and there was laughter all along the line as the Professor&nbsp; glared at them through his big glasses, and dragged their bacchanalian&nbsp; orgies to the light and held them up to scorn.&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing the execution he had done, the learned man turned to the lovely&nbsp; Diana, who stood as white and still as the plaster stag beside her, with&nbsp; sandals, bow, and crescent; quite perfect, and altogether the best piece&nbsp; of statuary in the show. She was very tenderly treated by the paternal&nbsp; critic who, merely alluding to her confirmed spinsterhood, fondness for&nbsp; athletic sports, and oracular powers, gave a graceful little exposition&nbsp; of true art and passed on to the last figure.&nbsp; &nbsp; This was Apollo in full fig, his curls skilfully arranged to hide a&nbsp; well-whitened patch over the eye, his handsome legs correctly poised,&nbsp; and his gifted fingers about to draw divine music from the silvered&nbsp; gridiron which was his lyre. His divine attributes were described, as&nbsp; well as his little follies and failings, among which were his weakness&nbsp; for photography and flute-playing, his attempts to run a newspaper, and&nbsp; his fondness for the society of the Muses; which latter slap produced&nbsp; giggles and blushes among the girl-graduates, and much mirth among the&nbsp; stricken youths; for misery loves company, and after this they began to&nbsp; rally.&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, with a ridiculous conclusion, the Professor bowed his thanks;&nbsp; and after several recalls the curtain fell, but not quickly enough to&nbsp; conceal Mercury, wildly waving his liberated legs, Hebe dropping her&nbsp; teapot, Bacchus taking a lovely roll on his barrel, and Mrs Juno rapping&nbsp; the impertinent Owlsdark on the head with Jove<U+2019>s ruler.&nbsp; &nbsp; While the audience filed out to supper in the hall, the stage was a&nbsp; scene of dire confusion as gods and goddesses, farmers and barons,&nbsp; maids and carpenters, congratulated one another on the success of their&nbsp; labours. Assuming various costumes, actors and actresses soon joined&nbsp; their guests, to sip bounteous draughts of praise with their coffee, and&nbsp; cool their modest blushes with ice-cream. Mrs Meg was a proud and happy&nbsp; woman when Miss Cameron came to her as she sat by Josie, with Demi&nbsp; serving both, and said, so cordially that it was impossible to doubt the&nbsp; sincerity of her welcome words:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mrs Brooke, I no longer wonder where your children get their talent.&nbsp; I make my compliments to the Baron and next summer you must let me have&nbsp; little <U+201C>Dolly<U+201D> as a pupil when we are at the beach.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; One can easily imagine how this offer was received, as well as the&nbsp; friendly commendation bestowed by the same kind critic on the work of&nbsp; Beaumont and Fletcher, who hastened to explain that this trifle was only&nbsp; an attempt to make nature and art go hand in hand, with little help from&nbsp; fine writing or imposing scenery. Everybody was in the happiest mood,&nbsp; especially <U+2018>little Dolly<U+2019>, who danced like a will-o<U+2019>-the-wisp with&nbsp; light-footed Mercury and Apollo as he promenaded with the Marquise on&nbsp; his arm, who seemed to have left her coquetry in the green room with her&nbsp; rouge.&nbsp; &nbsp; When all was over, Mrs Juno said to Jove, to whose arm she clung as they&nbsp; trudged home along the snowy paths: <U+2018>Fritz dear, Christmas is a good&nbsp; time for new resolutions, and I<U+2019>ve made one never to be impatient or&nbsp; fretful with my beloved husband again. I know I am, though you won<U+2019>t own&nbsp; it; but Laurie<U+2019>s fun had some truth in it, and I felt hit in a tender&nbsp; spot. Henceforth I am a model wife, else I don<U+2019>t deserve the dearest,&nbsp; best man ever born<U+2019>; and being in a dramatic mood, Mrs Juno tenderly&nbsp; embraced her excellent Jove in the moonlight, to the great amusement of&nbsp; sundry lingerers behind them.&nbsp; &nbsp; So all three plays might be considered successes, and that merry&nbsp; Christmas night a memorable one in the March family; for Demi got an&nbsp; unspoken question answered, Josie<U+2019>s fondest wish was granted, and,&nbsp; thanks to Professor Owlsdark<U+2019>s jest, Mrs Jo made Professor Bhaer<U+2019>s busy&nbsp; life quite a bed of roses by the keeping of her resolution. A few days&nbsp; later she had her reward for this burst of virtue in Dan<U+2019>s letter, which&nbsp; set her fears at rest and made her very happy, though she was unable to&nbsp; tell him so, because he sent her no address.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 15. WAITING&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My wife, I have bad news for thee,<U+2019> said Professor Bhaer, coming in one&nbsp; day early in January.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Please tell it at once. I can<U+2019>t bear to wait, Fritz,<U+2019> cried Mrs Jo,&nbsp; dropping her work and standing up as if to take the shot bravely.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But we must wait and hope, heart<U+2019>s-dearest. Come and let us bear it&nbsp; together. Emil<U+2019>s ship is lost, and as yet no news of him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was well Mr Bhaer had taken his wife into his strong arms, for she&nbsp; looked ready to drop, but bore up after a moment, and sitting by her&nbsp; good man, heard all that there was to tell. Tidings had been sent to the&nbsp; shipowners at Hamburg by some of the survivors, and telegraphed at once&nbsp; by Franz to his uncle. As one boat-load was safe, there was hope that&nbsp; others might also escape, though the gale had sent two to the bottom.&nbsp; A swift-sailing steamer had brought these scanty news, and happier ones&nbsp; might come at any hour; but kind Franz had not added that the sailors&nbsp; reported the captain<U+2019>s boat as undoubtedly wrecked by the falling mast,&nbsp; since the smoke hid its escape, and the gale soon drove all far asunder.&nbsp; But this sad rumour reached Plumfield in time; and deep was the mourning&nbsp; for the happyhearted Commodore, never to come singing home again. Mrs&nbsp; Jo refused to believe it, stoutly insisting that Emil would outlive&nbsp; any storm and yet turn up safe and gay. It was well she clung to this&nbsp; hopeful view, for poor Mr Bhaer was much afflicted by the loss of his&nbsp; boy, because his sister<U+2019>s sons had been his so long he scarcely knew a&nbsp; different love for his very own. Now was a chance for Mrs Juno to keep&nbsp; her word; and she did, speaking cheerily of Emil, even when hope waxed&nbsp; faint and her heart was heavy. If anything could comfort the Bhaers for&nbsp; the loss of one boy, it would have been the affection and sorrow shown&nbsp; by all the rest. Franz kept the cable busy with his varying messages,&nbsp; Nat sent loving letters from Leipzig, and Tom harassed the shipping&nbsp; agents for news. Even busy Jack wrote them with unusual warmth; Dolly&nbsp; and George came often, bearing the loveliest flowers and the&nbsp; daintiest bon-bons to cheer Mrs Bhaer and sweeten Josie<U+2019>s grief; while&nbsp; good-hearted Ned travelled all the way from Chicago to press their hands&nbsp; and say, with a tear in his eye: <U+2018>I was so anxious to hear all about the&nbsp; dear old boy, I couldn<U+2019>t keep away.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s right comfortable, and shows me that if I didn<U+2019>t teach my boys&nbsp; anything else, I did give them the brotherly love that will make them&nbsp; stand by one another all their lives,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, when he had gone.&nbsp; &nbsp; Rob answered reams of sympathizing letters, which showed how many&nbsp; friends they had; and the kindly praises of the lost man would have&nbsp; made Emil a hero and a saint, had they all been true. The elders bore&nbsp; it quietly, having learned submission in life<U+2019>s hard school; but the&nbsp; younger people rebelled; some hoped against hope and kept up, others&nbsp; despaired at once, and little Josie, Emil<U+2019>s pet cousin and playmate, was&nbsp; so broken-hearted nothing could comfort her. Nan dosed in vain, Daisy<U+2019>s&nbsp; cheerful words went by like the wind, and Bess<U+2019>s devices to amuse her&nbsp; all failed utterly. To cry in mother<U+2019>s arms and talk about the wreck,&nbsp; which haunted her even in her sleep, was all she cared to do; and Mrs&nbsp; Meg was getting anxious when Miss Cameron sent Josie a kind note bidding&nbsp; her learn bravely her first lesson in real tragedy, and be like the&nbsp; self-sacrificing heroines she loved to act. That did the little girl&nbsp; good, and she made an effort in which Teddy and Octoo helped her much;&nbsp; for the boy was deeply impressed by this sudden eclipse of the firefly&nbsp; whose light and life all missed when they were gone, and lured her out&nbsp; every day for long drives behind the black mare, who shook her silvery&nbsp; bells till they made such merry music Josie could not help listening to&nbsp; it, and whisked her over the snowy roads at a pace which set the blood&nbsp; dancing in her veins and sent her home strengthened and comforted by&nbsp; sunshine, fresh air, and congenial society--three aids young sufferers&nbsp; seldom can resist.&nbsp; &nbsp; As Emil was helping nurse Captain Hardy, safe and well, aboard the ship,&nbsp; all this sorrow would seem wasted; but it was not, for it drew many&nbsp; hearts more closely together by a common grief, taught some patience,&nbsp; some sympathy, some regret for faults that lie heavy on the conscience&nbsp; when the one sinned against is gone, and all of them the solemn lesson&nbsp; to be ready when the summons comes. A hush lay over Plumfield for weeks,&nbsp; and the studious faces on the hill reflected the sadness of those in the&nbsp; valley. Sacred music sounded from Parnassus to comfort all who heard;&nbsp; the brown cottage was beseiged with gifts for the little mourner, and&nbsp; Emil<U+2019>s flag hung at half-mast on the roof where he last sat with Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; So the weeks went heavily by till suddenly, like a thunderbolt out of a&nbsp; clear sky, came the news, <U+2018>All safe, letters on the way.<U+2019> Then up went&nbsp; the flag, out rang the college bells, bang went Teddy<U+2019>s long-unused&nbsp; cannon, and a chorus of happy voices cried <U+2018>Thank God<U+2019>, as people went&nbsp; about, laughing, crying, and embracing one another in a rapture of&nbsp; delight. By and by the longed-for letters came, and all the story of the&nbsp; wreck was told; briefly by Emil, eloquently by Mrs Hardy, gratefully by&nbsp; the captain, while Mary added a few tender words that went straight to&nbsp; their hearts and seemed the sweetest of all. Never were letters so read,&nbsp; passed round, admired, and cried over as these; for Mrs Jo carried them&nbsp; in her pocket when Mr Bhaer did not have them in his, and both took a&nbsp; look at them when they said their prayers at night. Now the Professor&nbsp; was heard humming like a big bee again as he went to his classes, and&nbsp; the lines smoothed out of Mother Bhaer<U+2019>s forehead, while she wrote this&nbsp; real story to anxious friends and let her romances wait. Now messages&nbsp; of congratulation flowed in, and beaming faces showed everywhere. Rob&nbsp; amazed his parents by producing a poem which was remarkably good for one&nbsp; of his years, and Demi set it to music that it might be sung when the&nbsp; sailor boy returned. Teddy stood on his head literally, and tore about&nbsp; the neighbourhood on Octoo, like a second Paul Revere--only his tidings&nbsp; were good. But best of all, little Josie lifted up her head as the&nbsp; snowdrops did, and began to bloom again, growing tall and quiet, with&nbsp; the shadow of past sorrow to tone down her former vivacity and show&nbsp; that she had learned a lesson in trying to act well her part on the real&nbsp; stage, where all have to take their share in the great drama of life.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now another sort of waiting began; for the travellers were on their way&nbsp; to Hamburg, and would stay there awhile before coming home, as Uncle&nbsp; Hermann owned the Brenda, and the captain must report to him. Emil must&nbsp; remain to Franz<U+2019>s wedding, deferred till now because of the season of&nbsp; mourning, so happily ended. These plans were doubly welcome and pleasant&nbsp; after the troublous times which went before, and no spring ever seemed&nbsp; so beautiful as this one; for, as Teddy put it:&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Now is the winter of our discontent&nbsp;      Made glorious by these sons of Bhaer!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Franz and Emil being regarded in the light of elder brothers by the real&nbsp; <U+2018>sons of Bhaer<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; There was great scrubbing and dusting among the matrons as they set&nbsp; their houses in order not only for Class Day, but to receive the bride&nbsp; and groom, who were to come to them for the honeymoon trip. Great plans&nbsp; were made, gifts prepared, and much joy felt at the prospect of seeing&nbsp; Franz again; though Emil, who was to accompany them, would be the&nbsp; greater hero. Little did the dear souls dream what a surprise was in&nbsp; store for them, as they innocently laid their plans and wished all the&nbsp; boys could be there to welcome home their eldest and their Casablanca.&nbsp; &nbsp; While they wait and work so happily, let us see how our other absent&nbsp; boys are faring as they too wait and work and hope for better days. Nat&nbsp; was toiling steadily along the path he had wisely chosen, though it was&nbsp; by no means strewn with flowers--quite thorny was it, in fact, and hard&nbsp; to travel, after the taste of ease and pleasure he had got when nibbling&nbsp; at forbidden fruit. But his crop of wild oats was a light one, and he&nbsp; resolutely reaped what he had sowed, finding some good wheat among&nbsp; the tares. He taught by day; he fiddled night after night in the dingy&nbsp; little theatre, and he studied so diligently that his master was well&nbsp; pleased, and kept him in mind as one to whom preferment was due, if any&nbsp; chance occurred. Gay friends forgot him; but the old ones stood fast,&nbsp; and cheered him up when Heimweh and weariness made him sad. As spring&nbsp; came on things mended--expenses grew less, work pleasanter, and life&nbsp; more bearable than when wintry storms beat on his thinly clad back, and&nbsp; frost pinched the toes that patiently trudged in old boots. No debts&nbsp; burdened him; the year of absence was nearly over; and if he chose to&nbsp; stay, Herr Bergmann had hopes for him that would bring independence for&nbsp; a time at least. So he walked under the lindens with a lighter heart,&nbsp; and in the May evenings went about the city with a band of strolling&nbsp; students, making music before houses where he used to sit as guest. No&nbsp; one recognized him in the darkness, though old friends often listened&nbsp; to the band; and once Minna threw him money, which he humbly received as&nbsp; part of his penance, being morbid on the subject of his sins.&nbsp; &nbsp; His reward came sooner than he expected, and was greater than he&nbsp; deserved, he thought, though his heart leaped with joy when his master&nbsp; one day informed him that he was chosen, with several other of his most&nbsp; promising pupils, to join the musical society which was to take part in&nbsp; the great festival in London the next July. Here was not only honour for&nbsp; the violinist but happiness for the man, as it brought him nearer home,&nbsp; and would open a chance of further promotion and profit in his chosen&nbsp; profession.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Make thyself useful to Bachmeister there in London with thy English,&nbsp; and if all goes well with him, he will be glad to take thee to America,&nbsp; whither he goes in the early autumn for winter concerts. Thou hast done&nbsp; well these last months, and I have hopes of thee.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As the great Bergmann seldom praised his pupils, these words filled&nbsp; Nat<U+2019>s soul with pride and joy, and he worked yet more diligently than&nbsp; before to fulfil his master<U+2019>s prophecy. He thought the trip to England&nbsp; happiness enough, but found room for more when, early in June, Franz&nbsp; and Emil paid him a flying visit, bringing all sorts of good news, kind&nbsp; wishes, and comfortable gifts for the lonely fellow, who could have&nbsp; fallen on their necks and cried like a girl at seeing his old mates&nbsp; again. How glad he was to be found in his little room busy at his proper&nbsp; work, not living like an idle gentleman on borrowed money! How proud&nbsp; he was to tell his plans, assure them that he had no debts, and receive&nbsp; their praises for his improvement in music, their respect for his&nbsp; economy and steadfastness in well-doing! How relieved when, having&nbsp; honestly confessed his shortcomings, they only laughed, and owned that&nbsp; they also had known like experiences, and were the wiser for them. He&nbsp; was to go to the wedding late in June, and join his comrades in London.&nbsp; As best man, he could not refuse the new suit Franz insisted on ordering&nbsp; for him; and a cheque from home about that time made him feel like a&nbsp; millionaire--and a happy one; for this was accompanied by such kind&nbsp; letters full of delight in his success, he felt that he had earned it,&nbsp; and waited for his joyful holiday with the impatience of a boy.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan meantime was also counting the weeks till August, when he would&nbsp; be free. But neither marriage-bells nor festival music awaited him; no&nbsp; friends would greet him as he left the prison; no hopeful prospect lay&nbsp; before him; no happy home-going was to be his. Yet his success was far&nbsp; greater than Nat<U+2019>s, though only God and one good man saw it. It was&nbsp; a hard-won battle; but he would never have to fight so terrible a&nbsp; one again; for though enemies would still assail from within and from&nbsp; without, he had found the little guide-book that Christian carried in&nbsp; his bosom, and Love, Penitence, and Prayer, the three sweet sisters, had&nbsp; given him the armour which would keep him safe. He had not learned to&nbsp; wear it yet, and chafed against it, though he felt its value, thanks to&nbsp; the faithful friend who had stood by him all that bitter year.&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon he was to be free again, worn and scarred in the fray, but out&nbsp; among men in the blessed sun and air. When he thought of it Dan felt as&nbsp; if he could not wait, but must burst that narrow cell and fly away,&nbsp; as the caddis-worms he used to watch by the brookside shed their stony&nbsp; coffins, to climb the ferns and soar into the sky. Night after night he&nbsp; lulled himself to sleep with planning how, when he had seen Mary Mason&nbsp; according to his promise, he would steer straight for his old friends,&nbsp; the Indians, and in the wilderness hide his disgrace and heal his&nbsp; wounds. Working to save the many would atone for the sin of killing&nbsp; one, he thought; and the old free life would keep him safe from the&nbsp; temptations that beset him in cities.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>By and by, when I<U+2019>m all right again, and have something to tell that&nbsp; I<U+2019>m not ashamed of, I<U+2019>ll go home,<U+2019> he said, with a quicker beat of the&nbsp; impetuous heart that longed to be there so intensely, he found it as&nbsp; hard to curb as one of his unbroken horses on the plains. <U+2018>Not yet. I&nbsp; must get over this first. They<U+2019>d see and smell and feel the prison taint&nbsp; on me, if I went now, and I couldn<U+2019>t look them in the face and hide&nbsp; the truth. I can<U+2019>t lose Ted<U+2019>s love, Mother Bhaer<U+2019>s confidence, and the&nbsp; respect of the girls, for they did respect my strength, anyway; but now&nbsp; they wouldn<U+2019>t touch me.<U+2019> And poor Dan looked with a shudder at the brown&nbsp; fist he clenched involuntarily as he remembered what it had done since&nbsp; a certain little white hand had laid in it confidingly. <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll make <U+2018>em&nbsp; proud of me yet; and no one shall ever know of this awful year. I can&nbsp; wipe it out, and I will, so help me God!<U+2019> And the clenched hand was held&nbsp; up as if to take a solemn oath that this lost year should yet be made&nbsp; good, if resolution and repentance could work the miracle.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 16. IN THE TENNIS-COURT&nbsp; &nbsp; Athletic sports were in high favour at Plumfield; and the river where&nbsp; the old punt used to wabble about with a cargo of small boys, or echo to&nbsp; the shrill screams of little girls trying to get lilies, now was&nbsp; alive with boats of all kinds, from the slender wherry to the trim&nbsp; pleasure-craft, gay with cushions, awnings, and fluttering pennons.&nbsp; Everyone rowed, and the girls as well as the youths had their races, and&nbsp; developed their muscles in the most scientific manner. The large, level&nbsp; meadow near the old willow was now the college playground, and here&nbsp; baseball battles raged with fury, varied by football, leaping, and&nbsp; kindred sports fitted to split the fingers, break the ribs, and strain&nbsp; the backs of the too ambitious participants. The gentler pastimes of the&nbsp; damsels were at a safe distance from this Champ de Mars; croquet mallets&nbsp; clicked under the elms that fringed the field, rackets rose and fell&nbsp; energetically in several tennis-courts, and gates of different heights&nbsp; were handy to practise the graceful bound by which every girl expected&nbsp; to save her life some day when the mad bull, which was always coming but&nbsp; never seemed to arrive, should be bellowing at her heels.&nbsp; &nbsp; One of these tennis grounds was called <U+2018>Jo<U+2019>s Court<U+2019>, and here the little&nbsp; lady ruled like a queen; for she was fond of the game, and being bent on&nbsp; developing her small self to the highest degree of perfection, she was&nbsp; to be found at every leisure moment with some victim hard at it. On a&nbsp; certain pleasant Saturday afternoon she had been playing with Bess and&nbsp; beating her; for, though more graceful, the Princess was less active&nbsp; than her cousin, and cultivated her roses by quieter methods.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh dear! you are tired, and every blessed boy is at that stupid&nbsp; baseball match. <U+2018>What shall I do?<U+2019> sighed Josie, pushing back the great&nbsp; red hat she wore, and gazing sadly round her for more worlds to conquer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll play presently, when I<U+2019>m a little cooler. But it is dull work for&nbsp; me, as I never win,<U+2019> answered Bess, fanning herself with a large leaf.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie was about to sit down beside her on the rustic seat and wait, when&nbsp; her quick eye saw afar off two manly forms arrayed in white flannel;&nbsp; their blue legs seemed bearing them towards the battle going on in the&nbsp; distance; but they never reached the fray; for with a cry of joy,&nbsp; Jo raced away to meet them, bent on securing this heaven-sent&nbsp; reinforcement. Both paused as she came flying up, and both raised their&nbsp; hats; but oh, the difference there was in the salutes! The stout youth&nbsp; pulled his off lazily and put it on again at once, as if glad to get the&nbsp; duty over; the slender being, with the crimson tie, lifted his with a&nbsp; graceful bend, and held it aloft while he accosted the rosy, breathless&nbsp; maid, thus permitting her to see his raven locks smoothly parted, with&nbsp; one little curl upon the brow. Dolly prided himself upon that bow, and&nbsp; practised it before his glass, but did not bestow it upon all alike,&nbsp; regarding it as a work of art, fit only for the fairest and most&nbsp; favoured of his female admirers; for he was a pretty youth, and fancied&nbsp; himself an Adonis.&nbsp; &nbsp; Eager Josie evidently did not appreciate the honour he did her, for with&nbsp; a nod she begged them both to <U+2018>come along and play tennis, not go and&nbsp; get all hot and dirty with the boys<U+2019>. These two adjectives won the day;&nbsp; for Stuffy was already warmer than he liked to be, and Dolly had on&nbsp; a new suit which he desired to keep immaculate as long as possible,&nbsp; conscious that it was very becoming.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Charmed to oblige,<U+2019> answered the polite one, with another bend.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You play, I<U+2019>ll rest,<U+2019> added the fat boy, yearning for repose and gentle&nbsp; converse with the Princess in the cooling shade.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, you can comfort Bess, for I<U+2019>ve beaten her all to bits and she&nbsp; needs amusing. I know you<U+2019>ve got something nice in your pocket, George;&nbsp; give her some, and <U+2018>Dolphus can have her racket. Now then, fly round<U+2019>;&nbsp; and driving her prey before her, Josie returned in triumph to the court.&nbsp; &nbsp; Casting himself ponderously upon the bench, which creaked under his&nbsp; weight, Stuffy--as we will continue to call him, though no one&nbsp; else dared to use the old name now--promptly produced the box of&nbsp; confectionery, without which he never travelled far, and regaled Bess&nbsp; with candied violets and other dainties, while Dolly worked hard to hold&nbsp; his own against a most accomplished antagonist. He would have beaten her&nbsp; if an unlucky stumble, which produced an unsightly stain upon the knee&nbsp; of those new shorts, had not distracted his mind and made him careless.&nbsp; Much elated at her victory, Josie permitted him to rest, and offered&nbsp; ironical consolation for the mishap which evidently weighed upon his&nbsp; mind.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t be an old Betty; it can be cleaned. You must have been a cat&nbsp; in some former state, you are so troubled about dirt; or a tailor, and&nbsp; lived for clothes.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come now, don<U+2019>t hit a fellow when he is down,<U+2019> responded Dolly from&nbsp; the grass where he and Stuffy now lay to make room for both girls on the&nbsp; seat. One handkerchief was spread under him, and his elbow leaned upon&nbsp; another, while his eyes were sadly fixed upon the green and brown spot&nbsp; which afflicted him. <U+2018>I like to be neat; don<U+2019>t think it civil to cut&nbsp; about in old shoes and grey flannel shirts before ladies. Our fellows&nbsp; are gentlemen, and dress as such,<U+2019> he added, rather nettled at the&nbsp; word <U+2018>tailor<U+2019>; for he owed one of those too attractive persons an&nbsp; uncomfortably big bill.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So are ours; but good clothes alone don<U+2019>t make a gentleman here. We&nbsp; require a good deal more,<U+2019> flashed Josie, in arms at once to defend&nbsp; her college. <U+2018>You will hear of some of the men in <U+201C>old boots and grey&nbsp; flannel<U+201D> when you and your fine gentlemen are twiddling your ties and&nbsp; scenting your hair in obscurity. I like old boots and wear them, and I&nbsp; hate dandies; don<U+2019>t you, Bess?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not when they are kind to me, and belong to our old set,<U+2019> answered&nbsp; Bess, with a nod of thanks to Dolly, who was carefully removing an&nbsp; inquisitive caterpillar from one of her little russet shoes.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I like a lady who is always polite, and doesn<U+2019>t snap a man<U+2019>s head off&nbsp; if he has a mind of his own; don<U+2019>t you, George?<U+2019> asked Dolly, with his&nbsp; best smile for Bess and a Harvard stare of disapprobation for Josie.&nbsp; &nbsp; A tranquil snore was Stuffy<U+2019>s sole reply, and a general laugh restored&nbsp; peace for the moment. But Josie loved to harass the lords of creation&nbsp; who asserted themselves too much, and bided her time for another attack&nbsp; till she had secured more tennis. She got another game; for Dolly was&nbsp; a sworn knight of dames, so he obeyed her call, leaving Bess to sketch&nbsp; George as he lay upon his back, his stout legs crossed, and his round&nbsp; red face partially eclipsed by his hat. Josie got beaten this time and&nbsp; came back rather cross, so she woke the peaceful sleeper by tickling his&nbsp; nose with a straw till he sneezed himself into a sitting posture, and&nbsp; looked wrathfully about for <U+2018>that confounded fly<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come, sit up and let us have a little elegant conversation; you&nbsp; <U+201C>howling swells<U+201D> ought to improve our minds and manners, for we are&nbsp; only poor <U+201C>country girls in dowdy gowns and hats<U+201D>,<U+2019> began the gad-fly,&nbsp; opening the battle with a sly quotation from one of Dolly<U+2019>s unfortunate&nbsp; speeches about certain studious damsels who cared more for books than&nbsp; finery.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I didn<U+2019>t mean you! Your gowns are all right, and those hats the latest&nbsp; thing out,<U+2019> began poor <U+2018>Dolphus, convicting himself by the incautious&nbsp; exclamation.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Caught you that time; I thought you fellows were all gentlemen, civil&nbsp; as well as nice. But you are always sneering at girls who don<U+2019>t dress&nbsp; well and that is a very unmanly thing to do; my mother said so<U+2019>; and&nbsp; Josie felt that she had dealt a shrewd blow at the elegant youth who&nbsp; bowed at many shrines if they were well-decorated ones.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Got you there, old boy, and she<U+2019>s right. You never hear me talk about&nbsp; clothes and such twaddle,<U+2019> said Stuffy, suppressing a yawn, and feeling&nbsp; for another bon-bon wherewith to refresh himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You talk about eating, and that is even worse for a man. You will marry&nbsp; a cook and keep a restaurant some day,<U+2019> laughed Josie, down on him at&nbsp; once.&nbsp; &nbsp; This fearful prediction kept him silent for several moments; but Dolly&nbsp; rallied, and wisely changing the subject, carried war into the enemy<U+2019>s&nbsp; camp.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>As you wanted us to improve your manners, allow me to say that young&nbsp; ladies in good society don<U+2019>t make personal remarks or deliver lectures.&nbsp; Little girls who are not out do it, and think it witty; but I assure you&nbsp; it<U+2019>s not good form.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie paused a moment to recover from the shock of being called <U+2018>a&nbsp; little girl<U+2019>, when all the honours of her fourteenth birthday were fresh&nbsp; upon her; and Bess said, in the lofty tone which was infinitely more&nbsp; crushing than Jo<U+2019>s impertinence:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That is true; but we have lived all our lives with superior people, so&nbsp; we have no society talk like your young ladies. We are so accustomed to&nbsp; sensible conversation, and helping one another by telling our faults,&nbsp; that we have no gossip to offer you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; When the Princess reproved, the boys seldom resented it; so Dolly held&nbsp; his peace, and Josie burst out, following her cousin<U+2019>s lead, which she&nbsp; thought a happy one:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Our boys like to have us talk with them, and take kindly any hints we&nbsp; give. They don<U+2019>t think they know everything and are quite perfect at&nbsp; eighteen, as I<U+2019>ve observed the Harvard men do, especially the very young&nbsp; ones.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie took immense satisfaction in that return shot; and Dolly showed&nbsp; that he was hit, by the nettled tone in which he answered, with a&nbsp; supercilious glance at the hot, dusty, and noisy crowd on the baseball&nbsp; ground: <U+2018>The class of fellows you have here need all the polish and&nbsp; culture you can give them; and I<U+2019>m glad they get it. Our men are largely&nbsp; from the best families all over the country, so we don<U+2019>t need girls to&nbsp; teach us anything.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s a pity you don<U+2019>t have more of such <U+201C>fellows<U+201D> as ours. They value&nbsp; and use well what college gives them, and aren<U+2019>t satisfied to slip&nbsp; through, getting all the fun they can and shirking the work. Oh, I<U+2019>ve&nbsp; heard you <U+201C>men<U+201D> talk, and heard your fathers say they wish they hadn<U+2019>t&nbsp; wasted time and money just that you might say you<U+2019>d been through&nbsp; college. As for the girls, you<U+2019>ll be much better off in all ways when&nbsp; they do get in, and keep you lazy things up to the mark, as we do here.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If you have such a poor opinion of us, why do you wear our colour?<U+2019>&nbsp; asked Dolly, painfully conscious that he was not improving the&nbsp; advantages his Alma Mater offered him, but bound to defend her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t; my hat is scarlet, not crimson. Much you know about a colour,<U+2019>&nbsp; scoffed Josie.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know that a cross cow would soon set you scampering, if you flaunted&nbsp; that red tile under her nose,<U+2019> retorted Dolly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m ready for her. Can your fine young ladies do this? or you either?<U+2019>&nbsp; and burning to display her latest accomplishment, Josie ran to the&nbsp; nearest gate, put one hand on the top rail, and vaulted over as lightly&nbsp; as a bird.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bess shook her head, and Stuffy languidly applauded; but Dolly scorning&nbsp; to be braved by a girl, took a flying leap and landed on his feet beside&nbsp; Josie, saying calmly: <U+2018>Can you do that?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not yet; but I will by and by.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As his foe looked a little crestfallen, Dolly relented, and affably&nbsp; added sundry feats of a like nature, quite unconscious that he had&nbsp; fallen into a dreadful snare; for the dull red paint on the gate, not&nbsp; being used to such vigorous handling, came off in streaks upon his&nbsp; shoulders when he turned a backward swing and came up smiling, to be&nbsp; rewarded with the aggravating remark:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If you want to know what crimson is, look at your back; it<U+2019>s nicely&nbsp; stamped on and won<U+2019>t wash out, I think.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The deuce it won<U+2019>t!<U+2019> cried Dolly, trying to get an impossible view, and&nbsp; giving it up in great disgust.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I guess we<U+2019>d better be going, Dolf,<U+2019> said peaceable Stuffy, feeling&nbsp; that it would be wise to retreat before another skirmish took place, as&nbsp; his side seemed to be getting the worst of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t hurry, I beg; stay and rest; you must need it after the&nbsp; tremendous amount of brain work you<U+2019>ve done this week. It is time for&nbsp; our Greek. Come, Bess. Good afternoon, gentlemen.<U+2019> And, with a sweeping&nbsp; courtesy, Josie led the way, with her hat belligerently cocked up, and&nbsp; her racket borne like a triumphal banner over one shoulder; for having&nbsp; had the last word, she felt that she could retire with the honours of&nbsp; war.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dolly gave Bess his best bow, with the chill on; and Stuffy subsided&nbsp; luxuriously, with his legs in the air, murmuring in a dreamy tone:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Little Jo is as cross as two sticks today. I<U+2019>m going in for another&nbsp; nap: too hot to play anything.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So it is. Wonder if Spitfire was right about these beastly spots?<U+2019>&nbsp; And Dolly sat down to try dry cleansing with one of his handkerchiefs.&nbsp; <U+2018>Asleep?<U+2019> he asked, after a few moments of this cheerful occupation,&nbsp; fearing that his chum might be too comfortable when he was in a fume&nbsp; himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No. I was thinking that Jo wasn<U+2019>t far wrong about shirking. <U+2018>Tis a&nbsp; shame to get so little done, when we ought to be grinding like Morton&nbsp; and Torry and that lot. I never wanted to go to college; but my governor&nbsp; made me. Much good it will do either of us!<U+2019> answered Stuffy, with a&nbsp; groan; for he hated work, and saw two more long years of it before him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Gives a man prestige, you know. No need to dig. I mean to have a gay&nbsp; old time, and be a <U+201C>howling swell<U+201D>, if I choose. Between you and me&nbsp; though, it would be no end jolly to have the girls along. Study be&nbsp; hanged! But if we<U+2019>ve got to turn the grindstone, it would be mighty nice&nbsp; to have some of the little dears to lend a hand. Wouldn<U+2019>t it now?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>d like three this minute--one to fan me, one to kiss me, and one&nbsp; to give me some iced lemonade!<U+2019> sighed Stuffy, with a yearning glance&nbsp; towards the house, whence no succour appeared.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How would root-beer do?<U+2019> asked a voice behind them, which made Dolly&nbsp; spring to his feet and Stuffy roll over like a startled porpoise.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sitting on the stile that crossed the wall near by was Mrs Jo, with two&nbsp; jugs slung over her shoulder by a strap, several tin mugs in her hand,&nbsp; and an old-fashioned sun-bonnet on her head.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I knew the boys would be killing themselves with ice-water; so I&nbsp; strolled down with some of my good, wholesome beer. They drank like&nbsp; fishes. But Silas was with me; so my cruse still holds out. Have some?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, thanks, very much. Let us pour it.<U+2019> And Dolly held the cup while&nbsp; Stuffy joyfully filled it; both very grateful, but rather afraid she had&nbsp; heard what went before the wish she fulfilled.&nbsp; &nbsp; She proved that she had by saying, as they stood drinking her health,&nbsp; while she sat between them, looking like a middle-aged vivandiere, with&nbsp; her jugs and mugs:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I was glad to hear you say you would like to have girls at your&nbsp; college; but I hope you will learn to speak more respectfully of them&nbsp; before they come; for that will be the first lesson they will teach&nbsp; you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Really, ma<U+2019>am, I was only joking,<U+2019> began Stuffy, gulping down his beer&nbsp; in a hurry.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So was I. I<U+2019>m sure I--I<U+2019>m devoted to <U+2018>em,<U+2019> stuttered Dolly,&nbsp; panic-stricken; for he saw that he was in for a lecture of some sort.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not in the right way. Frivolous girls may like to be called <U+201C>little&nbsp; dears<U+201D> and things of that sort; but the girls who love study wish to be&nbsp; treated like reasonable beings, not dolls to flirt with. Yes, I<U+2019>m going&nbsp; to preach; that<U+2019>s my business; so stand up and take it like men.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo laughed; but she was in earnest; for by various hints and signs&nbsp; during the past winter she knew that the boys were beginning to <U+2018>see&nbsp; life<U+2019> in the way she especially disapproved. Both were far from home,&nbsp; had money enough to waste, and were as inexperienced, curious, and&nbsp; credulous as most lads of their age. Not fond of books, therefore&nbsp; without the safeguard which keeps many studious fellows out of harm; one&nbsp; self-indulgent, indolent, and so used to luxury that pampering of the&nbsp; senses was an easy thing; the other vain, as all comely boys are, full&nbsp; of conceit, and so eager to find favour in the eyes of his comrades&nbsp; that he was ready for anything which would secure it. These traits and&nbsp; foibles made both peculiarly liable to the temptations which assail&nbsp; pleasure-loving and weak-willed boys. Mrs Jo knew them well, and had&nbsp; dropped many a warning word since they went to college; but till lately&nbsp; they seemed not to understand some of her friendly hints; now she was&nbsp; sure they would, and meant to speak out: for long experience with boys&nbsp; made her both bold and skilful in handling some of the dangers usually&nbsp; left to silence, till it is too late for anything but pity and reproach.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m going to talk to you like a mother, because yours are far away; and&nbsp; there are things that mothers can manage best, if they do their duty,<U+2019>&nbsp; she solemnly began from the depths of the sunbonnet.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Great Scott! We<U+2019>re in for it now!<U+2019> thought Dolly, in secret dismay;&nbsp; while Stuffy got the first blow by trying to sustain himself with&nbsp; another mug of beer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That won<U+2019>t hurt you; but I must warn you about drinking other things,&nbsp; George. Overeating is an old story; and a few more fits of illness will&nbsp; teach you to be wise. But drinking is a more serious thing, and leads&nbsp; to worse harm than any that can afflict your body alone. I hear you&nbsp; talk about wines as if you knew them and cared more for them than a&nbsp; boy should; and several times I<U+2019>ve heard jokes that meant mischief. For&nbsp; heaven<U+2019>s sake, don<U+2019>t begin to play with this dangerous taste <U+201C>for fun<U+201D>,&nbsp; as you say, or because it<U+2019>s the fashion, and the other fellows do. Stop&nbsp; at once, and learn that temperance in all things is the only safe rule.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Upon my honour, I only take wine and iron. I need a tonic, mother&nbsp; says, to repair the waste of brain-tissue while I<U+2019>m studying,<U+2019> protested&nbsp; Stuffy, putting down the mug as if it burnt his fingers.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Good beef and oatmeal will repair your tissues much better than any&nbsp; tonic of that sort. Work and plain fare are what you want; and I wish&nbsp; I had you here for a few months out of harm<U+2019>s way. I<U+2019>d Banting you, and&nbsp; fit you to run without puffing, and get on without four or five meals a&nbsp; day. What an absurd hand that is for a man! You ought to be ashamed&nbsp; of it!<U+2019> And Mrs Jo caught up the plump fist, with deep dimples at each&nbsp; knuckle, which was fumbling distressfully at the buckle of the belt girt&nbsp; about a waist far too large for a youth of his age.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I can<U+2019>t help it--we all grow fat; it<U+2019>s in the family,<U+2019> said Stuffy in&nbsp; self-defence.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>All the more reason you should live carefully. Do you want to die&nbsp; early, or be an invalid all your life?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, ma<U+2019>am!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Stuffy looked so scared that Mrs Jo could not be hard upon his budding&nbsp; sins, for they lay at his overindulgent mother<U+2019>s door line in a great&nbsp; measure; so she softened the tone of her voice, and added, with a little&nbsp; slap on the fat hand, as she used to do when it was small enough to&nbsp; pilfer lumps of sugar from her bowl:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Then be careful; for a man writes his character in his face; and you&nbsp; don<U+2019>t want gluttony and intemperance in yours, I know.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m sure I don<U+2019>t! Please make out a wholesome bill of fare, and I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; stick to it, if I can. I am getting stout, and I don<U+2019>t like it; and my&nbsp; liver<U+2019>s torpid, and I have palpitations and headache. Overwork, mother&nbsp; says; but it may be overeating.<U+2019> And Stuffy gave a sigh of mingled&nbsp; regret for the good things he renounced, and relief as he finished&nbsp; loosening his belt as soon as his hand was free.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I will; follow it, and in a year you<U+2019>ll be a man and not a meal-bag.&nbsp; Now, Dolly<U+2019>; and Mrs Jo turned to the other culprit, who shook in his&nbsp; shoes and wished he hadn<U+2019>t come.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Are you studying French as industriously as you were last winter?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No ma<U+2019>am; I don<U+2019>t care for it--that is, I, I<U+2019>m busy with G-Greek just&nbsp; now,<U+2019> answered Dolly, beginning bravely, quite in the dark as to what&nbsp; that odd question meant till a sudden memory made him stutter and look&nbsp; at his shoes with deep interest.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, he doesn<U+2019>t study it; only reads French novels and goes to the&nbsp; theatre when the opera bouffe is here,<U+2019> said Stuffy, innocently&nbsp; confirming Mrs Jo<U+2019>s suspicions.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So I understood; and that is what I want to speak about. Ted had a&nbsp; sudden desire to learn French in that way, from something you said,&nbsp; Dolly; so I went myself, and was quite satisfied that it was no place&nbsp; for a decent boy. Your men were out in full force; and I was glad to&nbsp; see that some of the younger ones looked as ashamed as I felt. The older&nbsp; fellows enjoyed it, and when we came out were waiting to take those&nbsp; painted girls to supper. Did you ever go with them?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Once.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Did you like it?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No <U+2018>m; I--I came away early,<U+2019> stammered Dolly, with a face as red as&nbsp; his splendid tie.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad you have not lost the grace of blushing yet; but you will&nbsp; soon, if you keep up this sort of study and forget to be ashamed. The&nbsp; society of such women will unfit you for that of good ones, and lead you&nbsp; into trouble and sin and shame. Oh, why don<U+2019>t the city fathers stop that&nbsp; evil thing, when they know the harm it does? It made my heart ache to&nbsp; see those boys, who ought to be at home and in their beds, going off for&nbsp; a night of riot which would help to ruin some of them for ever.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The youths looked scared at Mrs Jo<U+2019>s energetic protest against one of&nbsp; the fashionable pleasures of the day, and waited in conscience-stricken&nbsp; silence--Stuffy glad that he never went to those gay suppers, and&nbsp; Dolly deeply grateful that he <U+2018>came away early<U+2019>. With a hand on either&nbsp; shoulder, and all the terrors smoothed from her brow, Mrs Jo went on&nbsp; in her most motherly tone, anxious to do for them what no other woman&nbsp; would, and do it kindly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My dear boys, if I didn<U+2019>t love you, I would not say these things. I&nbsp; know they are not pleasant; but my conscience won<U+2019>t let me hold my peace&nbsp; when a word may keep you from two of the great sins that curse the world&nbsp; and send so many young men to destruction. You are just beginning to&nbsp; feel the allurement of them, and soon it will be hard to turn away. Stop&nbsp; now, I beg of you, and not only save yourselves but help others by&nbsp; a brave example. Come to me if things worry you; don<U+2019>t be afraid or&nbsp; ashamed; I have heard many sadder confessions than any you are ever&nbsp; likely to bring me, and been able to comfort many poor fellows, gone&nbsp; wrong for want of a word in time. Do this, and you will be able to&nbsp; kiss your mothers with clean lips, and by and by have the right to ask&nbsp; innocent girls to love you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes<U+2019>m, thank you. I suppose you<U+2019>re right; but it<U+2019>s pretty hard work&nbsp; to toe the mark when ladies give you wine and gentlemen take their&nbsp; daughters to see Aimee,<U+2019> said Dolly, foreseeing tribulations ahead&nbsp; though he knew it was time to <U+2018>pull up<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So it is; but all the more honour to those who are brave and wise&nbsp; enough to resist public opinion, and the easy-going morals of bad or&nbsp; careless men and women. Think of the persons whom you respect most, and&nbsp; in imitating them you will secure the respect of those who look up to&nbsp; you. I<U+2019>d rather my boys should be laughed at and cold-shouldered by a&nbsp; hundred foolish fellows than lose what, once gone, no power can give&nbsp; them back--innocence and self-respect. I don<U+2019>t wonder you find it&nbsp; <U+201C>hard to toe the mark<U+201D>, when books, pictures, ball-rooms, theatres, and&nbsp; streets offer temptations; yet you can resist, if you try. Last winter&nbsp; Mrs Brooke used to worry about John<U+2019>s being out so late reporting; but&nbsp; when she spoke to him about the things he must see and hear on his way&nbsp; to and fro from the office at midnight, he said in his sober way, <U+201C>I&nbsp; know what you mean, mother; but no fellow need to go wrong unless he&nbsp; wants to.<U+201D>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s like the Deacon!<U+2019> exclaimed Stuffy, with an approving smile on&nbsp; his fat face.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m glad you told me that. He<U+2019>s right; and it<U+2019>s because he doesn<U+2019>t want&nbsp; to go wrong we all respect him so,<U+2019> added Dolly, looking up now with&nbsp; an expression which assured his Mentor that the right string had been&nbsp; touched, and a spirit of emulation roused, more helpful, perhaps, than&nbsp; any words of hers. Seeing this, she was satisfied, and said, as she&nbsp; prepared to leave the bar before which her culprits had been tried and&nbsp; found guilty, but recommended to mercy:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Then be to others what John is to you--a good example. Forgive me for&nbsp; troubling you, my dear lads, and remember my little preachment. I think&nbsp; it will do you good, though I may never know it. Chance words spoken&nbsp; in kindness often help amazingly; and that<U+2019>s what old people are here&nbsp; for--else their experience is of little use. Now, come and find the&nbsp; young folk. I hope I shall never have to shut the gates of Plumfield&nbsp; upon you, as I have on some of your <U+201C>gentlemen<U+201D>. I mean to keep my&nbsp; boys and girls safe if I can, and this a wholesome place where the good&nbsp; old-fashioned virtues are lived and taught.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Much impressed by that dire threat, Dolly helped her from her perch with&nbsp; deep respect; and Stuffy relieved her of her empty jugs, solemnly vowing&nbsp; to abstain from all fermented beverages except root-beer, as long&nbsp; as feeble flesh could hold out. Of course they made light of <U+2018>Mother&nbsp; Bhaer<U+2019>s lecture<U+2019> when they were alone--that was to be expected of <U+2018>men&nbsp; of our class<U+2019> but in their secret souls they thanked her for giving&nbsp; their boyish consciences a jog, and more than once afterward had cause&nbsp; to remember gratefully that half-hour in the tennis court.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 17. AMONG THE MAIDS&nbsp; &nbsp; Although this story is about Jo<U+2019>s boys, her girls cannot be neglected,&nbsp; because they held a high place in this little republic, and especial&nbsp; care was taken to fit them to play their parts worthily in the great&nbsp; republic which offered them wider opportunities and more serious duties.&nbsp; To many the social influence was the better part of the training&nbsp; they received; for education is not confined to books, and the finest&nbsp; characters often graduate from no college, but make experience their&nbsp; master, and life their book. Others cared only for the mental culture,&nbsp; and were in danger of over-studying, under the delusion which pervades&nbsp; New England that learning must be had at all costs, forgetting that&nbsp; health and real wisdom are better. A third class of ambitious girls&nbsp; hardly knew what they wanted, but were hungry for whatever could fit&nbsp; them to face the world and earn a living, being driven by necessity,&nbsp; the urgency of some half-conscious talent, or the restlessness of&nbsp; strong young natures to break away from the narrow life which no longer&nbsp; satisfied.&nbsp; &nbsp; At Plumfield all found something to help them; for the growing&nbsp; institution had not yet made its rules as fixed as the laws of the&nbsp; Medes and Persians, and believed so heartily in the right of all&nbsp; sexes, colours, creeds, and ranks to education, that there was room&nbsp; for everyone who knocked, and a welcome to the shabby youths from up&nbsp; country, the eager girls from the West, the awkward freedman or woman&nbsp; from the South, or the well-born student whose poverty made this college&nbsp; a possibility when other doors were barred. There still was prejudice,&nbsp; ridicule, neglect in high places, and prophecies of failure to contend&nbsp; against; but the Faculty was composed of cheerful, hopeful men and women&nbsp; who had seen greater reforms spring from smaller roots, and after stormy&nbsp; seasons blossom beautifully, to add prosperity and honour to the nation.&nbsp; So they worked on steadily and bided their time, full of increasing&nbsp; faith in their attempt as year after year their numbers grew, their&nbsp; plans succeeded, and the sense of usefulness in this most vital of all&nbsp; professions blessed them with its sweet rewards.&nbsp; &nbsp; Among the various customs which had very naturally sprung up was one&nbsp; especially useful and interesting to <U+2018>the girls<U+2019>, as the young women&nbsp; liked to be called. It all grew out of the old sewing hour still kept up&nbsp; by the three sisters long after the little work-boxes had expanded into&nbsp; big baskets full of household mending. They were busy women, yet on&nbsp; Saturdays they tried to meet in one of the three sewing-rooms; for&nbsp; even classic Parnassus had its nook where Mrs Amy often sat among her&nbsp; servants, teaching them to make and mend, thereby giving them a respect&nbsp; for economy, since the rich lady did not scorn to darn her hose, and sew&nbsp; on buttons. In these household retreats, with books and work, and their&nbsp; daughters by them, they read and sewed and talked in the sweet privacy&nbsp; that domestic women love, and can make so helpful by a wise mixture of&nbsp; cooks and chemistry, table linen and theology, prosaic duties and good&nbsp; poetry.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Meg was the first to propose enlarging this little circle; for as&nbsp; she went her motherly rounds among the young women she found a sad lack&nbsp; of order, skill, and industry in this branch of education. Latin, Greek,&nbsp; the higher mathematics, and science of all sorts prospered finely; but&nbsp; the dust gathered on the work-baskets, frayed elbows went unheeded, and&nbsp; some of the blue stockings sadly needed mending. Anxious lest the usual&nbsp; sneer at learned women should apply to <U+2018>our girls<U+2019>, she gently lured two&nbsp; or three of the most untidy to her house, and made the hour so pleasant,&nbsp; the lesson so kindly, that they took the hint, were grateful for the&nbsp; favour, and asked to come again. Others soon begged to make the detested&nbsp; weekly duty lighter by joining the party, and soon it was a privilege&nbsp; so much desired that the old museum was refitted with sewing-machines,&nbsp; tables, rocking-chair, and a cheerful fireplace, so that, rain or shine,&nbsp; the needles might go on undisturbed.&nbsp; &nbsp; Here Mrs Meg was in her glory, and stood wielding her big shears like a&nbsp; queen as she cut out white work, fitted dresses, and directed Daisy, her&nbsp; special aide, about the trimming of hats, and completing the lace and&nbsp; ribbon trifles which add grace to the simplest costume and save poor&nbsp; or busy girls so much money and time. Mrs Amy contributed taste, and&nbsp; decided the great question of colours and complexions; for few women,&nbsp; even the most learned, are without that desire to look well which makes&nbsp; many a plain face comely, as well as many a pretty one ugly for want of&nbsp; skill and knowledge of the fitness of things. She also took her turn to&nbsp; provide books for the readings, and as art was her forte she gave them&nbsp; selections from Ruskin, Hamerton, and Mrs Jameson, who is never old.&nbsp; Bess read these aloud as her contribution, and Josie took her turn at&nbsp; the romances, poetry, and plays her uncles recommended. Mrs Jo gave&nbsp; little lectures on health, religion, politics, and the various questions&nbsp; in which all should be interested, with copious extracts from Miss&nbsp; Cobbe<U+2019>s Duties of Women, Miss Brackett<U+2019>s Education of American Girls,&nbsp; Mrs Duffy<U+2019>s No Sex in Education, Mrs Woolson<U+2019>s Dress Reform, and many of&nbsp; the other excellent books wise women write for their sisters, now that&nbsp; they are waking up and asking: <U+2018>What shall we do?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was curious to see the prejudices melt away as ignorance was&nbsp; enlightened, indifference change to interest, and intelligent minds&nbsp; set thinking, while quick wits and lively tongues added spice to the&nbsp; discussions which inevitably followed. So the feet that wore the neatly&nbsp; mended hose carried wiser heads than before, the pretty gowns covered&nbsp; hearts warmed with higher purposes, and the hands that dropped the&nbsp; thimbles for pens, lexicons, and celestial globes, were better fitted&nbsp; for life<U+2019>s work, whether to rock cradles, tend the sick, or help on the&nbsp; great work of the world.&nbsp; &nbsp; One day a brisk discussion arose concerning careers for women. Mrs Jo&nbsp; had read something on the subject and asked each of the dozen girls&nbsp; sitting about the room, what she intended to do on leaving college.&nbsp; The answers were as usual: <U+2018>I shall teach, help mother, study medicine,&nbsp; art,<U+2019> etc.; but nearly all ended with:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Till I marry.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But if you don<U+2019>t marry, what then?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, feeling like a girl&nbsp; again as she listened to the answers, and watched the thoughtful, gay,&nbsp; or eager faces.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Be old maids, I suppose. Horrid, but inevitable, since there are so&nbsp; many superfluous women,<U+2019> answered a lively lass, too pretty to fear&nbsp; single blessedness unless she chose it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is well to consider that fact, and fit yourselves to be useful, not&nbsp; superfluous women. That class, by the way, is largely made up of widows,&nbsp; I find; so don<U+2019>t consider it a slur on maidenhood.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s a comfort! Old maids aren<U+2019>t sneered at half as much as they used&nbsp; to be, since some of them have grown famous and proved that woman isn<U+2019>t&nbsp; a half but a whole human being, and can stand alone.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t like it all the same. We can<U+2019>t all be like Miss Nightingale, Miss&nbsp; Phelps, and the rest.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; So what can we do but sit in a corner and look on?<U+2019> asked a plain girl&nbsp; with a dissatisfied expression.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Cultivate cheerfulness and content, if nothing else. But there are so&nbsp; many little odd jobs waiting to be done that nobody need <U+201C>sit idle and&nbsp; look on<U+201D>, unless she chooses,<U+2019> said Mrs Meg, with a smile, laying on the&nbsp; girl<U+2019>s head the new hat she had just trimmed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Thank you very much. Yes, Mrs Brooke, I see; it<U+2019>s a little job, but&nbsp; it makes me neat and happy--and grateful,<U+2019> she added, looking up with&nbsp; brighter eyes as she accepted the labour of love and the lesson as&nbsp; sweetly as they were given.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>One of the best and most beloved women I know has been doing odd jobs&nbsp; for the Lord for years, and will keep at it till her dear hands are&nbsp; folded in her coffin. All sorts of things she does--picks up neglected&nbsp; children and puts them in safe homes, saves lost girls, nurses poor&nbsp; women in trouble, sews, knits, trots, begs, works for the poor day after&nbsp; day with no reward but the thanks of the needy, the love and honour&nbsp; of the rich who make Saint Matilda their almoner. That<U+2019>s a life worth&nbsp; living; and I think that quiet little woman will get a higher seat in&nbsp; Heaven than many of those of whom the world has heard.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know it<U+2019>s lovely, Mrs Bhaer; but it<U+2019>s dull for young folks. We do&nbsp; want a little fun before we buckle to,<U+2019> said a Western girl with a&nbsp; wide-awake face.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Have your fun, my dear; but if you must earn your bread, try to make it&nbsp; sweet with cheerfulness, not bitter with the daily regret that it isn<U+2019>t&nbsp; cake. I used to think mine was a very hard fate because I had to amuse&nbsp; a somewhat fretful old lady; but the books I read in that lonely library&nbsp; have been of immense use to me since, and the dear old soul bequeathed&nbsp; me Plumfield for my <U+201C>cheerful service and affectionate care<U+201D>. I didn<U+2019>t&nbsp; deserve it, but I did use to try to be jolly and kind, and get as&nbsp; much honey out of duty as I could, thanks to my dear mother<U+2019>s help and&nbsp; advice.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Gracious! if I could earn a place like this, I<U+2019>d sing all day and be an&nbsp; angel; but you have to take your chance, and get nothing for your pains,&nbsp; perhaps. I never do,<U+2019> said the Westerner, who had a hard time with small&nbsp; means and large aspirations.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t do it for the reward; but be sure it will come, though not in the&nbsp; shape you expect. I worked hard for fame and money one winter; but I&nbsp; got neither, and was much disappointed. A year afterwards I found I had&nbsp; earned two prizes: skill with my pen, and Professor Bhaer.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo<U+2019>s laugh was echoed blithely by the girls, who liked to have these&nbsp; conversations enlivened by illustrations from life.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are a very lucky woman,<U+2019> began the discontented damsel, whose soul&nbsp; soared above new hats, welcome as they were, but did not quite know&nbsp; where to steer.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yet her name used to be <U+201C>Luckless Jo<U+201D>, and she never had what she&nbsp; wanted till she had given up hoping for it,<U+2019> said Mrs Meg.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll give up hoping, then, right away, and see if my wishes will come.&nbsp; I only want to help my folks, and get a good school.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Take this proverb for your guide: <U+201C>Get the distaff ready, and the Lord&nbsp; will send the flax<U+201D>,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We<U+2019>d better all do that, if we are to be spinsters,<U+2019> said the pretty&nbsp; one, adding gaily, <U+2018>I think I should like it, on the whole--they are so&nbsp; independent. My Aunt Jenny can do just what she likes, and ask no one<U+2019>s&nbsp; leave; but Ma has to consult Pa about everything. Yes, I<U+2019>ll give you my&nbsp; chance, Sally, and be a <U+201C>superfluum<U+201D>, as Mr Plock says.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You<U+2019>ll be one of the first to go into bondage, see if you aren<U+2019>t. Much&nbsp; obliged, all the same.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, I<U+2019>ll get my distaff ready, and take whatever flax the Fates&nbsp; send--single, or double-twisted, as the powers please.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That is the right spirit, Nelly. Keep it up, and see how happy life&nbsp; will be with a brave heart, a willing hand, and plenty to do.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No one objects to plenty of domestic work or fashionable pleasure, I&nbsp; find; but the minute we begin to study, people tell us we can<U+2019>t bear it,&nbsp; and warn us to be very careful. I<U+2019>ve tried the other things, and got so&nbsp; tired I came to college; though my people predict nervous exhaustion and&nbsp; an early death. Do you think there is any danger?<U+2019> asked a stately girl,&nbsp; with an anxious glance at the blooming face reflected in the mirror&nbsp; opposite.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Are you stronger or weaker than when you came two years ago, Miss&nbsp; Winthrop?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Stronger in body, and much happier in mind. I think I was dying of&nbsp; ennui; but the doctors called it inherited delicacy of constitution.&nbsp; That is why mamma is so anxious, and I wish not to go too fast.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t worry, my dear; that active brain of yours was starving for good&nbsp; food; it has plenty now, and plain living suits you better than luxury&nbsp; and dissipation. It is all nonsense about girls not being able to study&nbsp; as well as boys. Neither can bear cramming; but with proper care both&nbsp; are better for it; so enjoy the life your instinct led you to, and we&nbsp; will prove that wise headwork is a better cure for that sort of delicacy&nbsp; than tonics, and novels on the sofa, where far too many of our girls&nbsp; go to wreck nowadays. They burn the candle at both ends; and when they&nbsp; break down they blame the books, not the balls.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dr Nan was telling me about a patient of hers who thought she had&nbsp; heart-complaint, till Nan made her take off her corsets, stopped her&nbsp; coffee and dancing all night, and made her eat, sleep, walk, and live&nbsp; regularly for a time; and now she<U+2019>s a brilliant cure. Common sense&nbsp; versus custom, Nan said.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve had no headaches since I came here, and can do twice as much&nbsp; studying as I did at home. It<U+2019>s the air, I think, and the fun of going&nbsp; ahead of the boys,<U+2019> said another girl, tapping her big forehead with&nbsp; her thimble, as if the lively brain inside was in good working order and&nbsp; enjoyed the daily gymnastics she gave it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Quality, not quantity, wins the day, you know. Our brains may be&nbsp; smaller, but I don<U+2019>t see that they fall short of what is required of&nbsp; them; and if I<U+2019>m not mistaken, the largest-headed man in our class is&nbsp; the dullest,<U+2019> said Nelly, with a solemn air which produced a gale of&nbsp; merriment; for all knew that the young Goliath she mentioned had been&nbsp; metaphorically slain by this quick-witted David on many a battle-field,&nbsp; to the great disgust of himself and his mates.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mrs Brooke, do I gauge on the right or the wrong side?<U+2019> asked the&nbsp; best Greek scholar of her class, eyeing a black silk apron with a lost&nbsp; expression.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The right, Miss Pierson; and leave a space between the tucks; it looks&nbsp; prettier so.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll never make another; but it will save my dresses from ink-stains,&nbsp; so I<U+2019>m glad I<U+2019>ve got it<U+2019>; and the erudite Miss Pierson laboured on,&nbsp; finding it a harder task than any Greek root she ever dug up.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We paper-stainers must learn how to make shields, or we are lost.&nbsp; I<U+2019>ll give you a pattern of the pinafore I used to wear in my&nbsp; <U+201C>blood-and-thunder days<U+201D>, as we call them,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, trying to&nbsp; remember what became of the old tin-kitchen which used to hold her&nbsp; works.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Speaking of writers reminds me that my ambition is to be a George&nbsp; Eliot, and thrill the world! It must be so splendid to know that one&nbsp; has such power, and to hear people own that one possesses a <U+201C>masculine&nbsp; intellect<U+201D>! I don<U+2019>t care for most women<U+2019>s novels, but hers are immense;&nbsp; don<U+2019>t you think so, Mrs Bhaer?<U+2019> asked the girl with the big forehead,&nbsp; and torn braid on her skirt.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes; but they don<U+2019>t thrill me as little Charlotte Bronte<U+2019>s books do.&nbsp; The brain is there, but the heart seems left out. I admire, but I don<U+2019>t&nbsp; love, George Eliot; and her life is far sadder to me than Miss Bronte<U+2019>s,&nbsp; because, in spite of the genius, love, and fame, she missed the light&nbsp; without which no soul is truly great, good, or happy.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes<U+2019>m, I know; but still it<U+2019>s so romantic and sort of new and&nbsp; mysterious, and she was great in one sense. Her nerves and dyspepsia do&nbsp; rather destroy the illusion; but I adore famous people and mean to go&nbsp; and see all I can scare up in London some day.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You will find some of the best of them busy about just the work I&nbsp; recommend to you; and if you want to see a great lady, I<U+2019>ll tell you&nbsp; that Mrs Laurence means to bring one here today. Lady Abercrombie is&nbsp; lunching with her, and after seeing the college is to call on us. She&nbsp; especially wanted to see our sewing-school, as she is interested in&nbsp; things of this sort, and gets them up at home.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless me! I always imagined lords and ladies did nothing but ride round&nbsp; in a coach and six, go to balls, and be presented to the Queen in cocked&nbsp; hats, and trains and feathers,<U+2019> exclaimed an artless young person from&nbsp; the wilds of Maine, whither an illustrated paper occasionally wandered.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Not at all; Lord Abercrombie is over here studying up our American&nbsp; prison system, and my lady is busy with the schools--both very&nbsp; high-born, but the simplest and most sensible people I<U+2019>ve met this long&nbsp; time. They are neither of them young nor handsome, and dress plainly;&nbsp; so don<U+2019>t expect anything splendid. Mr Laurence was telling me last night&nbsp; about a friend of his who met my lord in the hall, and owing to a rough&nbsp; greatcoat and a red face, mistook him for a coachman, and said: <U+201C>Now,&nbsp; my man, what do you want here?<U+201D> Lord Abercrombie mildly mentioned who&nbsp; he was, and that he had come to dinner. And the poor host was much&nbsp; afflicted, saying afterward: <U+201C>Why didn<U+2019>t he wear his stars and garters?&nbsp; then a fellow would know he was a lord.<U+201D><U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The girls laughed again, and a general rustle betrayed that each was&nbsp; prinking a bit before the titled guest arrived. Even Mrs Jo settled her&nbsp; collar, and Mrs Meg felt if her cap was right, while Bess shook out&nbsp; her curls and Josie boldly consulted the glass; for they were women, in&nbsp; spite of philosophy and philanthropy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Shall we all rise?<U+2019> asked one girl, deeply impressed by the impending&nbsp; honour.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It would be courteous.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Shall we shake hands?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, I<U+2019>ll present you en masse, and your pleasant faces will be&nbsp; introduction enough.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I wish I<U+2019>d worn my best dress. Ought to have told us,<U+2019> whispered Sally.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Won<U+2019>t my folks be surprised when I tell them we have had a real lady to&nbsp; call on us?<U+2019> said another.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t look as if you<U+2019>d never seen a gentlewoman before, Milly. We are&nbsp; not all fresh from the wilderness,<U+2019> added the stately damsel who, having&nbsp; Mayflower ancestors, felt that she was the equal of all the crowned&nbsp; heads of Europe.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hush, she<U+2019>s coming! Oh, my heart, what a bonnet!<U+2019> cried the gay girl in&nbsp; a stage whisper; and every eye was demurely fixed upon the busy hands as&nbsp; the door opened to admit Mrs Laurence and her guest.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was rather a shock to find, after the general introduction was over,&nbsp; that this daughter of a hundred earls was a stout lady in a plain gown,&nbsp; and a rather weather-beaten bonnet, with a bag of papers in one hand&nbsp; and a note-book in the other. But the face was full of benevolence, the&nbsp; sonorous voice very kind, the genial manners very winning, and about the&nbsp; whole person an indescribable air of high breeding which made beauty of&nbsp; no consequence, costume soon forgotten, and the moment memorable to the&nbsp; keen-eyed girls whom nothing escaped.&nbsp; &nbsp; A little chat about the rise, growth, and success of this particular&nbsp; class, and then Mrs Jo led the conversation to the English lady<U+2019>s&nbsp; work, anxious to show her pupils how rank dignifies labour, and charity&nbsp; blesses wealth.&nbsp; &nbsp; It was good for these girls to hear of the evening-schools supported and&nbsp; taught by women whom they knew and honoured; of Miss Cobbe<U+2019>s eloquent&nbsp; protest winning the protection of the law for abused wives; Mrs Butler&nbsp; saving the lost; Mrs Taylor, who devoted one room in her historic house&nbsp; to a library for the servants; Lord Shaftesbury, busy with his new&nbsp; tenement-houses in the slums of London; of prison reforms; and all the&nbsp; brave work being done in God<U+2019>s name by the rich and great for the humble&nbsp; and the poor. It impressed them more than many quiet home lectures would&nbsp; have done, and roused an ambition to help when their time should come,&nbsp; well knowing that even in glorious America there is still plenty to be&nbsp; done before she is what she should be--truly just, and free, and great.&nbsp; They were also quick to see that Lady Abercrombie treated all there as&nbsp; her equals, from stately Mrs Laurence, to little Josie, taking notes&nbsp; of everything and privately resolving to have some thick-soled English&nbsp; boots as soon as possible. No one would have guessed that she had a&nbsp; big house in London, a castle in Wales, and a grand country seat in&nbsp; Scotland, as she spoke of Parnassus with admiration, Plumfield as a&nbsp; <U+2018>dear old home<U+2019>, and the college as an honour to all concerned in it.&nbsp; At that, of course, every head went up a little, and when my lady left,&nbsp; every hand was ready for the hearty shake the noble Englishwoman gave&nbsp; them, with words they long remembered:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I am very pleased to see this much-neglected branch of a woman<U+2019>s&nbsp; education so well conducted here, and I have to thank my friend&nbsp; Mrs Laurence for one of the most charming pictures I<U+2019>ve seen in&nbsp; America--Penelope among her maids.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; A group of smiling faces watched the stout boots trudge away, respectful&nbsp; glances followed the shabby bonnet till it was out of sight, and the&nbsp; girls felt a truer respect for their titled guest than if she had come&nbsp; in the coach and six, with all her diamonds on.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I feel better about the <U+201C>odd jobs<U+201D> now. I only wish I could do them as&nbsp; well as Lady Abercrombie does,<U+2019> said one.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I thanked my stars my buttonholes were nice, for she looked at them and&nbsp; said: <U+201C>Quite workmanlike, upon my word,<U+201D> added another, feeling that her&nbsp; gingham gown had come to honour.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Her manners were as sweet and kind as Mrs Brooke<U+2019>s. Not a bit stiff or&nbsp; condescending, as I expected. I see now what you meant, Mrs Bhaer, when&nbsp; you said once that well-bred people were the same all the world over.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Meg bowed her thanks for the compliment, and Mrs Bhaer said:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know them when I see them, but never shall be a model of deportment&nbsp; myself. I<U+2019>m glad you enjoyed the little visit. Now, if you young people&nbsp; don<U+2019>t want England to get ahead of us in many ways, you must bestir&nbsp; yourselves and keep abreast; for our sisters are in earnest, you see,&nbsp; and don<U+2019>t waste time worrying about their sphere, but make it wherever&nbsp; duty calls them.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We will do our best, ma<U+2019>am,<U+2019> answered the girls heartily, and trooped&nbsp; away with their work-baskets, feeling that though they might never be&nbsp; Harriet Martineaus, Elizabeth Brownings, or George Eliots, they might&nbsp; become noble, useful, and independent women, and earn for themselves&nbsp; some sweet title from the grateful lips of the poor, better than any a&nbsp; queen could bestow.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 18. CLASS DAY&nbsp; &nbsp; The clerk of the weather evidently has a regard for young people, and&nbsp; sends sunshine for class days as often as he can. An especially lovely&nbsp; one shone over Plumfield as this interesting anniversary came round,&nbsp; bringing the usual accompaniments of roses, strawberries, white-gowned&nbsp; girls, beaming youths, proud friends, and stately dignitaries full of&nbsp; well-earned satisfaction with the yearly harvest. As Laurence College&nbsp; was a mixed one, the presence of young women as students gave to the&nbsp; occasion a grace and animation entirely wanting where the picturesque&nbsp; half of creation appear merely as spectators. The hands that turned the&nbsp; pages of wise books also possessed the skill to decorate the hall with&nbsp; flowers; eyes tired with study shone with hospitable warmth on the&nbsp; assembling guests; and under the white muslins beat hearts as full of&nbsp; ambition, hope, and courage as those agitating the broadcloth of the&nbsp; ruling sex.&nbsp; &nbsp; College Hill, Parnassus, and old Plum swarmed with cheery faces, as&nbsp; guests, students, and professors hurried to and fro in the pleasant&nbsp; excitement of arriving and receiving. Everyone was welcomed cordially,&nbsp; whether he rolled up in a fine carriage, or trudged afoot to see the&nbsp; good son or daughter come to honour on the happy day that rewarded&nbsp; many a mutual sacrifice. Mr Laurie and his wife were on the reception&nbsp; committee, and their lovely house was overflowing. Mrs Meg, with Daisy&nbsp; and Jo as aides, was in demand among the girls, helping on belated&nbsp; toilettes, giving an eye to spreads, and directing the decorations. Mrs&nbsp; Jo had her hands full as President<U+2019>s lady, and the mother of Ted; for it&nbsp; took all the power and skill of that energetic woman to get her son into&nbsp; his Sunday best.&nbsp; &nbsp; Not that he objected to be well arrayed; far from it; he adored good&nbsp; clothes, and owing to his great height already revelled in a dress-suit,&nbsp; bequeathed him by a dandy friend. The effect was very funny; but he&nbsp; would wear it in spite of the jeers of his mates, and sighed vainly for&nbsp; a beaver, because his stern parent drew the line there. He pleaded that&nbsp; English lads of ten wore them and were <U+2018>no end nobby<U+2019>; but his mother&nbsp; only answered, with a consoling pat of the yellow mane:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My child, you are absurd enough now; if I let you add a tall hat,&nbsp; Plumfield wouldn<U+2019>t hold either of us, such would be the scorn and&nbsp; derision of all beholders. Content yourself with looking like the ghost&nbsp; of a waiter, and don<U+2019>t ask for the most ridiculous head-gear in the&nbsp; known world.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Denied this noble badge of manhood, Ted soothed his wounded soul by&nbsp; appearing in collars of an amazing height and stiffness, and ties which&nbsp; were the wonder of all female eyes. This freak was a sort of vengeance&nbsp; on his hard-hearted mother; for the collars drove the laundress to&nbsp; despair, never being just right, and the ties required such art in&nbsp; the tying that three women sometimes laboured long before--like Beau&nbsp; Brummel--he turned from a heap of <U+2018>failures<U+2019> with the welcome words:&nbsp; <U+2018>That will do.<U+2019> Rob was devoted on these trying occasions, his own&nbsp; toilet being distinguished only by its speed, simplicity, and neatness.&nbsp; Ted was usually in a frenzy before he was suited, and roars, whistles,&nbsp; commands, and groans were heard from the den wherein the Lion raged and&nbsp; the Lamb patiently toiled. Mrs Jo bore it till boots were hurled and a&nbsp; rain of hair-brushes set in, then, fearing for the safety of her eldest,&nbsp; she would go to the rescue, and by a wise mixture of fun and authority&nbsp; finally succeed in persuading Ted that he was <U+2018>a thing of beauty<U+2019>,&nbsp; if not <U+2018>a joy for ever<U+2019>. At last he would stalk majestically forth,&nbsp; imprisoned in collars compared to which those worn by Dickens<U+2019>s&nbsp; afflicted Biler were trifles not worth mentioning. The dresscoat was&nbsp; a little loose in the shoulders, but allowed a noble expanse of glossy&nbsp; bosom to be seen, and with a delicate handkerchief negligently drooping&nbsp; at the proper angle, had a truly fine effect. Boots that shone,&nbsp; and likewise pinched, appeared at one end of the <U+2018>long, black&nbsp; clothes-pin<U+2019>--as Josie called him---and a youthful but solemn face at&nbsp; the other, carried at an angle which, if long continued, would have&nbsp; resulted in spinal curvature. Light gloves, a cane, and--oh, bitter drop&nbsp; in the cup of joy!--an ignominious straw hat, not to mention a choice&nbsp; floweret in the buttonhole, and a festoon of watchguard below, finished&nbsp; off this impressive boy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How<U+2019>s that for style?<U+2019> he asked, appearing to his mother and cousins&nbsp; whom he was to escort to the hall on this particular occasion.&nbsp; &nbsp; A shout of laughter greeted him, followed by exclamations of horror;&nbsp; for he had artfully added the little blond moustache he often wore when&nbsp; acting. It was very becoming, and seemed the only balm to heal the wound&nbsp; made by the loss of the beloved hat.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Take it off this moment, you audacious boy! What would your father say&nbsp; to such a prank on this day when we must all behave our best?<U+2019> said Mrs&nbsp; Jo, trying to frown, but privately thinking that among the many youths&nbsp; about her none were so beautiful and original as her long son.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let him wear it, Aunty; it<U+2019>s so becoming. No one will ever guess he&nbsp; isn<U+2019>t eighteen at least,<U+2019> cried Josie, to whom disguise of any sort was&nbsp; always charming.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Father won<U+2019>t observe it; he<U+2019>ll be absorbed in his big-wigs and the&nbsp; girls. No matter if he does, he<U+2019>ll enjoy the joke and introduce me as&nbsp; his oldest son. Rob is nowhere when I<U+2019>m in full fig<U+2019>; and Ted took the&nbsp; stage with a tragic stalk, like Hamlet in a tail-coat and choker.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My son, obey me!<U+2019> and when Mrs Jo spoke in that tone her word was&nbsp; law. Later, however, the moustache appeared, and many strangers firmly&nbsp; believed that there were three young Bhaers. So Ted found one ray of joy&nbsp; to light his gloom.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr Bhaer was a proud and happy man when, at the appointed hour, he&nbsp; looked down upon the parterre of youthful faces before him, thinking of&nbsp; the <U+2018>little gardens<U+2019> in which he had hopefully and faithfully sowed good&nbsp; seed years ago, and from which this beautiful harvest seemed to have&nbsp; sprung. Mr March<U+2019>s fine old face shone with the serenest satisfaction,&nbsp; for this was the dream of his life fulfilled after patient waiting; and&nbsp; the love and reverence in the countenances of the eager young men and&nbsp; women looking up at him plainly showed that the reward he coveted was&nbsp; his in fullest measure. Laurie always effaced himself on these occasions&nbsp; as much as courtesy would permit; for everyone spoke gratefully in ode,&nbsp; poem, and oration of the founder of the college and noble dispenser of&nbsp; his beneficence. The three sisters beamed with pride as they sat among&nbsp; the ladies, enjoying, as only women can, the honour done the men&nbsp; they loved; while <U+2018>the original Plums<U+2019>, as the younger ones called&nbsp; themselves, regarded the whole affair as their work, receiving the&nbsp; curious, admiring, or envious glances of strangers with a mixture of&nbsp; dignity and delight rather comical to behold.&nbsp; &nbsp; The music was excellent, and well it might be when Apollo waved the&nbsp; baton. The poems were--as usual on such occasions--of varied excellence,&nbsp; as the youthful speakers tried to put old truths into new words, and&nbsp; made them forceful by the enthusiasm of their earnest faces and fresh&nbsp; voices. It was beautiful to see the eager interest with which the girls&nbsp; listened to some brilliant brother-student, and applauded him with a&nbsp; rustle as of wind over a bed of flowers. It was still more significant&nbsp; and pleasant to watch the young men<U+2019>s faces when a slender white figure&nbsp; stood out against the background of black-coated dignitaries, and with&nbsp; cheeks that flushed and paled, and lips that trembled till earnest&nbsp; purpose conquered maiden fear, spoke to them straight out of a woman<U+2019>s&nbsp; heart and brain concerning the hopes and doubts, the aspirations and&nbsp; rewards all must know, desire, and labour for. This clear, sweet voice&nbsp; seemed to reach and rouse all that was noblest in the souls of these&nbsp; youths, and to set a seal upon the years of comradeship which made them&nbsp; sacred and memorable for ever.&nbsp; &nbsp; Alice Heath<U+2019>s oration was unanimously pronounced the success of the day;&nbsp; for without being flowery or sentimental, as is too apt to be the case&nbsp; with these first efforts of youthful orators, it was earnest, sensible,&nbsp; and so inspiring that she left the stage in a storm of applause, the&nbsp; good fellows being as much fired by her stirring appeal to <U+2018>march&nbsp; shoulder to shoulder<U+2019>, as if she had chanted the <U+2018>Marseillaise<U+2019> then&nbsp; and there. One young man was so excited that he nearly rushed out of his&nbsp; seat to receive her as she hastened to hide herself among her mates, who&nbsp; welcomed her with faces full of tender pride and tearful eye. A prudent&nbsp; sister detained him, however, and in a moment he was able to listen with&nbsp; composure to the President<U+2019>s remarks.&nbsp; &nbsp; They were worth listening to, for Mr Bhaer spoke like a father to the&nbsp; children whom he was dismissing to the battle of life; and his tender,&nbsp; wise, and helpful words lingered in their hearts long after the praise&nbsp; was forgotten. Then came other exercises peculiar to Plumfield, and the&nbsp; end. Why the roof did not fly off when the sturdy lungs of the excited&nbsp; young men pealed out the closing hymn will for ever be a mystery; but&nbsp; it remained firm, and only the fading garlands vibrated as the waves of&nbsp; music rolled up and died away, leaving sweet echoes to haunt the place&nbsp; for another year.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dinners and spreads consumed the afternoon, and at sunset came a slight&nbsp; lull as everyone sought some brief repose before the festivities of the&nbsp; evening began. The President<U+2019>s reception was one of the enjoyable things&nbsp; in store, also dancing on Parnassus, and as much strolling, singing, and&nbsp; flirting, as could be compressed into a few hours by youths and maidens&nbsp; just out of school.&nbsp; &nbsp; Carriages were rolling about, and gay groups on piazzas, lawns, and&nbsp; window-seats idly speculated as to who the distinguished guests might&nbsp; be. The appearance of a very dusty vehicle loaded with trunks at Mr&nbsp; Bhaer<U+2019>s hospitably open door caused much curious comment among the&nbsp; loungers, especially as two rather foreign-looking gentlemen sprang out,&nbsp; followed by two young ladies, all four being greeted with cries of joy&nbsp; and much embracing by the Bhaers. Then they all disappeared into the&nbsp; house, the luggage followed, and the watchers were left to wonder who&nbsp; the mysterious strangers were, till a fair collegian declared that they&nbsp; must be the Professor<U+2019>s nephews, one of whom was expected on his wedding&nbsp; journey.&nbsp; &nbsp; She was right; Franz proudly presented his blonde and buxom bride, and&nbsp; she was hardly kissed and blessed when Emil led up his bonny English&nbsp; Mary, with the rapturous announcement:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Uncle, Aunt Jo, here<U+2019>s another daughter! Have you room for my wife,&nbsp; too?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; There could be no doubt of that; and Mary was with difficulty rescued&nbsp; from the glad embraces of her new relatives, who, remembering all the&nbsp; young pair had suffered together, felt that this was the natural and&nbsp; happy ending of the long voyage so perilously begun.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But why not tell us, and let us be ready for two brides instead of&nbsp; one?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, looking as usual rather demoralizing in a wrapper&nbsp; and crimping-pins, having rushed down from her chamber, where she was&nbsp; preparing for the labours of the evening.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, I remembered what a good joke you all considered Uncle Laurie<U+2019>s&nbsp; marriage, and I thought I<U+2019>d give you another nice little surprise,<U+2019>&nbsp; laughed Emil. <U+2018>I<U+2019>m off duty, and it seemed best to take advantage of&nbsp; wind and tide, and come along as convoy to the old boy here. We hoped to&nbsp; get in last night, but couldn<U+2019>t fetch it, so here we are in time for the&nbsp; end of the jollification, anyway.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ah, my sons, it is too feeling-full to see you both so happy and again&nbsp; in the old home. I haf no words to outpour my gratitude, and can&nbsp; only ask of the dear Gott in Himmel to bless and keep you all,<U+2019> cried&nbsp; Professor Bhaer, trying to gather all four into his arms at once, while&nbsp; tears rolled down his cheeks, and his English failed him.&nbsp; &nbsp; An April shower cleared the air and relieved the full hearts of the&nbsp; happy family; then of course everyone began to talk--Franz and Ludmilla&nbsp; in German with uncle, Emil and Mary with the aunts; and round this group&nbsp; gathered the young folk, clamouring to hear all about the wreck, and the&nbsp; rescue, and the homeward voyage. It was a very different story from the&nbsp; written one; and as they listened to Emil<U+2019>s graphic words, with Mary<U+2019>s&nbsp; soft voice breaking in now and then to add some fact that brought out&nbsp; the courage, patience, and self-sacrifice he so lightly touched upon, it&nbsp; became a solemn and pathetic thing to see and hear these happy creatures&nbsp; tell of that great danger and deliverance.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I never hear the patter of rain now that I don<U+2019>t want to say my&nbsp; prayers; and as for women, I<U+2019>d like to take my hat off to every one of&nbsp; <U+2018>em, for they are braver than any man I ever saw,<U+2019> said Emil, with the&nbsp; new gravity that was as becoming to him as the new gentleness with which&nbsp; he treated everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If women are brave, some men are as tender and self-sacrificing as&nbsp; women. I know one who in the night slipped his share of food into a&nbsp; girl<U+2019>s pocket, though starving himself, and sat for hours rocking a sick&nbsp; man in his arms that he might get a little sleep. No, love, I will tell,&nbsp; and you must let me!<U+2019> cried Mary, holding in both her own the hand he&nbsp; laid on her lips to silence her.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Only did my duty. If that torment had lasted much longer I might&nbsp; have been as bad as poor Barry and the boatswain. Wasn<U+2019>t that an awful&nbsp; night?<U+2019> And Emil shuddered as he recalled it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t think of it, dear. Tell about the happy days on the Urania, when&nbsp; papa grew better and we were all safe and homeward bound,<U+2019> said Mary,&nbsp; with the trusting look and comforting touch which seemed to banish the&nbsp; dark and recall the bright side of that terrible experience.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil cheered up at once, and sitting with his arm about his <U+2018>dear lass<U+2019>,&nbsp; in true sailor fashion told the happy ending of the tale.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Such a jolly old time as we had at Hamburg! Uncle Hermann couldn<U+2019>t do&nbsp; enough for the captain, and while mamma took care of him, Mary looked&nbsp; after me. I had to go into dock for repairs; fire hurt my eyes, and&nbsp; watching for a sail and want of sleep made <U+2018>em as hazy as a London fog.&nbsp; She was pilot and brought me in all right, you see, only I couldn<U+2019>t part&nbsp; company, so she came aboard as first mate, and I<U+2019>m bound straight for&nbsp; glory now.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hush! that<U+2019>s silly, dear,<U+2019> whispered Mary, trying in her turn to stop&nbsp; him, with English shyness about tender topics. But he took the soft hand&nbsp; in his, and proudly surveying the one ring it wore, went on with the air&nbsp; of an admiral aboard his flagship.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The captain proposed waiting a spell; but I told him we weren<U+2019>t like&nbsp; to see any rougher weather than we<U+2019>d pulled through together, and if we&nbsp; didn<U+2019>t know one another after such a year as this, we never should. I&nbsp; was sure I shouldn<U+2019>t be worth my pay without this hand on the wheel; so&nbsp; I had my way, and my brave little woman has shipped for the long voyage.&nbsp; God bless her!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Shall you really sail with him?<U+2019> asked Daisy, admiring her courage, but&nbsp; shrinking with cat-like horror from the water.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m not afraid,<U+2019> answered Mary, with a loyal smile. <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve proved my&nbsp; captain in fair weather and in foul, and if he is ever wrecked again,&nbsp; I<U+2019>d rather be with him than waiting and watching ashore.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A true woman, and a born sailor<U+2019>s wife! You are a happy man, Emil, and&nbsp; I<U+2019>m sure this trip will be a prosperous one,<U+2019> cried Mrs Jo, delighted&nbsp; with the briny flavour of this courtship. <U+2018>Oh, my dear boy, I always&nbsp; felt you<U+2019>d come back, and when everyone else despaired I never gave up,&nbsp; but insisted that you were clinging to the main-top jib somewhere on&nbsp; that dreadful sea<U+2019>; and Mrs Jo illustrated her faith by grasping Emil&nbsp; with a truly Pillycoddian gesture.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Of course I was!<U+2019> answered Emil heartily; <U+2018>and my <U+201C>main-top jib<U+201D> in&nbsp; this case was the thought of what you and Uncle said to me. That kept&nbsp; me up; and among the million thoughts that came to me during those&nbsp; long nights none was clearer than the idea of the red strand, you&nbsp; remember--English navy, and all that. I liked the notion, and resolved&nbsp; that if a bit of my cable was left afloat, the red stripe should be&nbsp; there.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And it was, my dear, it was! Captain Hardy testifies to that, and here&nbsp; is your reward<U+2019>; and Mrs Jo kissed Mary with a maternal tenderness&nbsp; which betrayed that she liked the English rose better than the blue-eyed&nbsp; German Kornblumen, sweet and modest though it was.&nbsp; &nbsp; Emil surveyed the little ceremony with complacency, saying, as he looked&nbsp; about the room which he never thought to see again: <U+2018>Odd, isn<U+2019>t it,&nbsp; how clearly trifles come back to one in times of danger? As we floated&nbsp; there, half-starved, and in despair, I used to think I heard the bells&nbsp; ringing here, and Ted tramping downstairs, and you calling, <U+201C>Boys, boys,&nbsp; it<U+2019>s time to get up!<U+201D> I actually smelt the coffee we used to have,&nbsp; and one night I nearly cried when I woke from a dream of Asia<U+2019>s ginger&nbsp; cookies. I declare, it was one of the bitterest disappointments of my&nbsp; life to face hunger with that spicy smell in my nostrils. If you<U+2019>ve got&nbsp; any, do give me one!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; A pitiful murmur broke from all the aunts and cousins, and Emil was at&nbsp; once borne away to feast on the desired cookies, a supply always being&nbsp; on hand. Mrs Jo and her sister joined the other group, glad to hear what&nbsp; Franz was saying about Nat.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The minute I saw how thin and shabby he was, I knew that something was&nbsp; wrong; but he made light of it, and was so happy over our visit and&nbsp; news that I let him off with a brief confession, and went to Professor&nbsp; Baumgarten and Bergmann. From them I learned the whole story of&nbsp; his spending more money than he ought and trying to atone for it by&nbsp; unnecessary work and sacrifice. Baumgarten thought it would do him good,&nbsp; so kept his secret till I came. It did him good, and he<U+2019>s paid his debts&nbsp; and earned his bread by the sweat of his brow, like an honest fellow.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I like that much in Nat. It is, as I said, a lesson, and he learns&nbsp; it well. He proves himself a man, and has deserved the place Bergmann&nbsp; offers him,<U+2019> said Mr Bhaer, looking well pleased as Franz added some&nbsp; facts already recorded.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I told you, Meg, that he had good stuff in him, and love for Daisy&nbsp; would keep him straight. Dear lad, I wish I had him here this moment!<U+2019>&nbsp; cried Mrs Jo, forgetting in delight the doubts and anxieties which had&nbsp; troubled her for months past.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I am very glad, and suppose I shall give in as I always do, especially&nbsp; now that the epidemic rages so among us. You and Emil have set all their&nbsp; heads in a ferment, and Josie will be demanding a lover before I can&nbsp; turn round,<U+2019> answered Mrs Meg, in a tone of despair.&nbsp; &nbsp; But her sister saw that she was touched by Nat<U+2019>s trials, and hastened&nbsp; to add the triumphs, that the victory might be complete, for success is&nbsp; always charming.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This offer of Herr Bergmann is a good one, isn<U+2019>t it?<U+2019> she asked, though&nbsp; Mr Laurie had already satisfied her on that point when Nat<U+2019>s letter&nbsp; brought the news.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Very fine in every way. Nat will get capital drill in Bachmeister<U+2019>s&nbsp; orchestra, see London in a delightful way, and if he suits come home&nbsp; with them, well started among the violins. No great honour, but a sure&nbsp; thing and a step up. I congratulated him, and he was very jolly over it,&nbsp; saying, like the true lover he is: <U+201C>Tell Daisy; be sure and tell her all&nbsp; about it.<U+201D> I<U+2019>ll leave that to you, Aunt Meg, and you can also break it&nbsp; gently to her that the old boy had a fine blond beard. Very becoming;&nbsp; hides his weak mouth, and gives a noble air to his big eyes and&nbsp; <U+201C>Mendelssohnian brow<U+201D>, as a gushing girl called it. Ludmilla has a photo&nbsp; of it for you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; This amused them; and they listened to many other interesting bits of&nbsp; news which kind Franz, even in his own happiness, had not forgotten to&nbsp; remember for his friend<U+2019>s sake. He talked so well, and painted Nat<U+2019>s&nbsp; patient and pathetic shifts so vividly, that Mrs Meg was half won;&nbsp; though if she had learned of the Minna episode and the fiddling in&nbsp; beer-gardens and streets, she might not have relented so soon. She&nbsp; stored up all she heard, however, and, womanlike, promised herself a&nbsp; delicious talk with Daisy, in which she would allow herself to melt by&nbsp; degrees, and perhaps change the doubtful <U+2018>We shall see<U+2019> to a cordial <U+2018>He&nbsp; has done well; be happy, dear<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the midst of this agreeable chat the sudden striking of a clock&nbsp; recalled Mrs Jo from romance to reality, and she exclaimed, with a&nbsp; clutch at her crimping-pins:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My blessed people, you must eat and rest; and I must dress, or receive&nbsp; in this disgraceful rig. Meg, will you take Ludmilla and Mary upstairs&nbsp; and see to them? Franz knows the way to the dining-room. Fritz, come&nbsp; with me and be made tidy, for what with heat and emotion, we are both&nbsp; perfect wrecks.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 19. WHITE ROSES&nbsp; &nbsp; While the travellers refreshed, and Mrs President struggled into her&nbsp; best gown, Josie ran into the garden to gather flowers for the brides.&nbsp; The sudden arrival of these interesting beings had quite enchanted&nbsp; the romantic girl, and her head was full of heroic rescues, tender&nbsp; admiration, dramatic situations, and feminine wonder as to whether the&nbsp; lovely creatures would wear their veils or not. She was standing before&nbsp; a great bush of white roses, culling the most perfect for the bouquets&nbsp; which she meant to tie with the ribbon festooned over her arm, and lay&nbsp; on the toilette tables of the new cousins, as a delicate attention. A&nbsp; step startled her, and looking up she saw her brother coming down the&nbsp; path with folded arms, bent head, and the absent air of one absorbed in&nbsp; deep thought.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Sophy Wackles,<U+2019> said the sharp child, with a superior smile, as&nbsp; she sucked her thumb just pricked by a too eager pull at the thorny&nbsp; branches.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What are you at here, Mischief?<U+2019> asked Demi, with an Irvingesque start,&nbsp; as he felt rather than saw a disturbing influence in his day-dream.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Getting flowers for <U+201C>our brides<U+201D>. Don<U+2019>t you wish you had one?<U+2019> answered&nbsp; Josie, to whom the word <U+2018>mischief<U+2019> suggested her favourite amusement.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A bride or a flower?<U+2019> asked Demi calmly, though he eyed the blooming&nbsp; bush as if it had a sudden and unusual interest for him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Both; you get the one, and I<U+2019>ll give you the other.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Wish I could!<U+2019> and Demi picked a little bud, with a sigh that went to&nbsp; Josie<U+2019>s warm heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Why don<U+2019>t you, then? It<U+2019>s lovely to see people so happy. Now<U+2019>s a good&nbsp; time to do it if you ever mean to. She will be going away for ever&nbsp; soon.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Who?<U+2019> and Demi pulled a half-opened bud, with a sudden colour in his&nbsp; own face; which sign of confusion delighted little Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t be a hypocrite. You know I mean Alice. Now, Jack, I<U+2019>m fond&nbsp; of you, and want to help; it<U+2019>s so interesting--all these lovers and&nbsp; weddings and things, and we ought to have our share. So you take my&nbsp; advice and speak up like a man, and make sure of Alice before she goes.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi laughed at the seriousness of the small girl<U+2019>s advice; but he liked&nbsp; it, and showed that it suited him by saying blandly, instead of snubbing&nbsp; her as usual:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are very kind, child. Since you are so wise, could you give me a&nbsp; hint how I<U+2019>d better <U+2018>speak up<U+2019>, as you elegantly express it?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, well, there are various ways, you know. In plays the lovers go down&nbsp; on their knees; but that<U+2019>s awkward when they have long legs. Ted never&nbsp; does it well, though I drill him for hours. You could say, <U+201C>Be mine,&nbsp; be mine!<U+201D> like the old man who threw cucumbers over the wall to Mrs&nbsp; Nickleby, if you want to be gay and easy; or you could write a poetical&nbsp; pop. You<U+2019>ve tried it, I dare say.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But seriously, Jo, I do love Alice, and I think she knows it. I want&nbsp; to tell her so; but I lose my head when I try, and don<U+2019>t care to make a&nbsp; fool of myself. Thought you might suggest some pretty way; you read so&nbsp; much poetry and are so romantic.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi tried to express himself clearly, but forgot his dignity and his&nbsp; usual reserve in the sweet perplexity of his love, and asked his little&nbsp; sister to teach him how to put the question which a single word can&nbsp; answer. The arrival of his happy cousins had scattered all his wise&nbsp; plans and brave resolutions to wait still longer. The Christmas play&nbsp; had given him courage to hope, and the oration today had filled him with&nbsp; tender pride; but the sight of those blooming brides and beaming grooms&nbsp; was too much for him, and he panted to secure his Alice without an&nbsp; hour<U+2019>s delay. Daisy was his confidante in all things but this; a&nbsp; brotherly feeling of sympathy had kept him from telling her his hopes,&nbsp; because her own were forbidden. His mother was rather jealous of any&nbsp; girl he admired; but knowing that she liked Alice, he loved on and&nbsp; enjoyed his secret alone, meaning soon to tell her all about it.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now suddenly Josie and the rose-bush seemed to suggest a speedy end&nbsp; to his tender perplexities; and he was moved to accept her aid as the&nbsp; netted lion did that of the mouse.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I think I<U+2019>ll write,<U+2019> he was slowly beginning, after a pause during&nbsp; which both were trying to strike out a new and brilliant idea.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve got it! perfectly lovely! just suit her, and you too, being a&nbsp; poet!<U+2019> cried Josie, with a skip.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What is it? Don<U+2019>t be ridiculous, please,<U+2019> begged the bashful lover,&nbsp; eager, but afraid of this sharp-tongued bit of womanhood.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I read in one of Miss Edgeworth<U+2019>s stories about a man who offers three&nbsp; roses to his lady--a bud, a half-blown, and a full-blown rose. I don<U+2019>t&nbsp; remember which she took; but it<U+2019>s a pretty way; and Alice knows about&nbsp; it because she was there when we read it. Here are all kinds; you<U+2019>ve got&nbsp; the two buds, pick the sweetest rose you can find, and I<U+2019>ll tie them up&nbsp; and put them in her room. She is coming to dress with Daisy, so I can do&nbsp; it nicely.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi mused a moment with his eyes on the bridal bush, and a smile came&nbsp; over his face so unlike any it had ever worn before, that Josie was&nbsp; touched, and looked away as if she had no right to see the dawn of the&nbsp; great passion which, while it lasts, makes a young man as happy as a&nbsp; god.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do it,<U+2019> was all he said, and gathered a full-blown rose to finish his&nbsp; floral love-message.&nbsp; &nbsp; Charmed to have a finger in this romantic pie, Josie tied a graceful&nbsp; bow of ribbon about the stems, and finished her last nosegay with much&nbsp; content, while Demi wrote upon a card:&nbsp; &nbsp; DEAR ALICE, You know what the flowers mean. Will you wear one, or all&nbsp; tonight, and make me still prouder, fonder, and happier than I am?&nbsp; &nbsp; Yours entirely,&nbsp; &nbsp; JOHN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Offering this to his sister, he said in a tone that made her feel the&nbsp; deep importance of her mission:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I trust you, Jo. This means everything to me. No jokes, dear, if you&nbsp; love me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie<U+2019>s answer was a kiss that promised all things; and then she ran&nbsp; away to do her <U+2018>gentle spiriting<U+2019>, like Ariel, leaving Demi to dream&nbsp; among the roses like Ferdinand.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mary and Ludmilla were charmed with their bouquets; and the giver had&nbsp; the delight of putting some of the flowers into the dark hair and&nbsp; the light as she played maid at the toilettes of <U+2018>our brides<U+2019>, which&nbsp; consoled her for a disappointment in the matter of veils.&nbsp; &nbsp; No one helped Alice dress; for Daisy was in the next room with her&nbsp; mother; and not even their loving eyes saw the welcome which the little&nbsp; posy received, nor the tears and smiles and blushes that came and went&nbsp; as she read the note and pondered what answer she should give. There was&nbsp; no doubt about the one she wished to give; but duty held her back; for&nbsp; at home there was an invalid mother and an old father. She was needed&nbsp; there, with all the help she could now bring by the acquirements four&nbsp; years of faithful study had given her. Love looked very sweet, and a&nbsp; home of her own with John a little heaven on earth; but not yet. And&nbsp; she slowly laid away the full-blown rose as she sat before the mirror,&nbsp; thinking over the great question of her life.&nbsp; &nbsp; Was it wise and kind to ask him to wait, to bind him by any promise,&nbsp; or even to put into words the love and honour she felt for him? No; it&nbsp; would be more generous to make the sacrifice alone, and spare him the&nbsp; pain of hope deferred. He was young; he would forget; and she would do&nbsp; her duty better, perhaps, if no impatient lover waited for her. With&nbsp; eyes that saw but dimly, and a hand that lingered on the stem he had&nbsp; stripped of thorns, she laid the half-blown flower by the rose, and&nbsp; asked herself if even the little bud might be worn. It looked very poor&nbsp; and pale beside the others; yet being in the self-sacrificing mood which&nbsp; real love brings, she felt that even a small hope was too much to give,&nbsp; if she could not follow it up with more.&nbsp; &nbsp; As she sat looking sadly down on the symbols of an affection that grew&nbsp; dearer every moment, she listened half unconsciously to the murmur of&nbsp; voices in the adjoining room. Open windows, thin partitions, and the&nbsp; stillness of summer twilight made it impossible to help hearing, and in&nbsp; a few moments more she could not refrain; for they were talking of John.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So nice of Ludmilla to bring us all bottles of real German cologne!&nbsp; Just what we need after this tiring day! Be sure John has his! He likes&nbsp; it so!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, mother. Did you see him jump up when Alice ended her oration?&nbsp; He<U+2019>d have gone to her if I hadn<U+2019>t held him back. I don<U+2019>t wonder he was&nbsp; pleased and proud. I spoilt my gloves clapping, and quite forgot my&nbsp; dislike of seeing women on platforms, she was so earnest and unconscious&nbsp; and sweet after the first moment.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Has he said anything to you, dear?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No; and I guess why. The kind boy thinks it would make me unhappy. It&nbsp; wouldn<U+2019>t. But I know his ways; so I wait, and hope all will go well with&nbsp; him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It must. No girl in her senses would refuse our John, though he isn<U+2019>t&nbsp; rich, and never will be. Daisy, I<U+2019>ve been longing to tell you what he&nbsp; did with his money. He told me last night, and I<U+2019>ve had no time since to&nbsp; tell you. He sent poor young Barton to the hospital, and kept him there&nbsp; till his eyes were saved--a costly thing to do. But the man can work now&nbsp; and care for his old parents. He was in despair, sick and poor, and too&nbsp; proud to beg; and our dear boy found it out, and took every penny he&nbsp; had, and never told even his mother till she made him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alice did not hear what Daisy answered, for she was busy with her own&nbsp; emotions--happy ones now, to judge from the smile that shone in her eyes&nbsp; and the decided gesture with which she put the little bud in her bosom,&nbsp; as if she said: <U+2018>He deserves some reward for that good deed, and he&nbsp; shall have it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Meg was speaking, and still of John, when she could hear again:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Some people would call it unwise and reckless, when John has so little;&nbsp; but I think his first investment a safe and good one, for <U+201C>he who giveth&nbsp; to the poor lendeth to the Lord<U+201D>; and I was so pleased and proud, I&nbsp; wouldn<U+2019>t spoil it by offering him a penny.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is his having nothing to offer that keeps him silent, I think. He&nbsp; is so honest, he won<U+2019>t ask till he has much to give. But he forgets that&nbsp; love is everything. I know he<U+2019>s rich in that; I see and feel it; and any&nbsp; woman should be glad to get it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Right, dear. I felt just so, and was willing to work and wait with and&nbsp; for my John.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So she will be, and I hope they will find it out. But she is so dutiful&nbsp; and good, I<U+2019>m afraid she won<U+2019>t let herself be happy. You would like it,&nbsp; mother?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Heartily; for a better, nobler girl doesn<U+2019>t live. She is all I want for&nbsp; my son; and I don<U+2019>t mean to lose the dear, brave creature if I can help&nbsp; it. Her heart is big enough for both love and duty; and they can wait&nbsp; more happily if they do it together--for wait they must, of course.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m so glad his choice suits you, mother, and he is spared the saddest&nbsp; sort of disappointment.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Daisy<U+2019>s voice broke there; and a sudden rustle, followed by a soft&nbsp; murmur, seemed to tell that she was in her mother<U+2019>s arms, seeking and&nbsp; finding comfort there.&nbsp; &nbsp; Alice heard no more, and shut her window with a guilty feeling but a&nbsp; shining face; for the proverb about listeners failed here, and she had&nbsp; learned more than she dared to hope. Things seemed to change suddenly;&nbsp; she felt that her heart was large enough for both love and duty; she&nbsp; knew now that she would be welcomed by mother and sister; and the memory&nbsp; of Daisy<U+2019>s less happy fate, Nat<U+2019>s weary probation, the long delay,&nbsp; and possible separation for ever--all came before her so vividly that&nbsp; prudence seemed cruelty; self-sacrifice, sentimental folly; and anything&nbsp; but the whole truth, disloyalty to her lover. As she thought thus,&nbsp; the half-blown rose went to join the bud; and then, after a pause, she&nbsp; slowly kissed the perfect rose, and added it to the tell-tale group,&nbsp; saying to herself with a sort of sweet solemnity, as if the words were a&nbsp; vow:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll love and work and wait with and for my John.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was well for her that Demi was absent when she stole down to join the&nbsp; guests who soon began to flow through the house in a steady stream.&nbsp; The new brightness which touched her usually thoughtful face was easily&nbsp; explained by the congratulations she received as orator, and the slight&nbsp; agitation observable, when a fresh batch of gentlemen approached soon&nbsp; passed, as none of them noticed the flowers she wore over a very happy&nbsp; heart. Demi meantime was escorting certain venerable personages about&nbsp; the college, and helping his grandfather entertain them with discussion&nbsp; of the Socratic method of instruction, Pythagoras, Pestalozzi, Froebel,&nbsp; and the rest, whom he devoutly wished at the bottom of the Red Sea, and&nbsp; no wonder, for his head and his heart were full of love and roses, hopes&nbsp; and fears. He piloted the <U+2018>potent, grave, and reverend seigniors<U+2019> safely&nbsp; down to Plumfield at last, and landed them before his uncle and aunt&nbsp; Bhaer, who were receiving in state, the one full of genuine delight in&nbsp; all men and things, the other suffering martyrdom with a smile, as she&nbsp; stood shaking hand after hand, and affecting utter unconsciousness of&nbsp; the sad fact that ponderous Professor Plock had camped upon the train of&nbsp; her state and festival velvet gown.&nbsp; &nbsp; With a long sigh of relief Demi glanced about him for the beloved girl.&nbsp; Most persons would have looked some time before any particular angel&nbsp; could be discovered among the white-robed throng in parlours, hall,&nbsp; and study; but his eye went--like the needle to the pole--to the corner&nbsp; where a smooth dark head, with its braided crown, rose like a queen<U+2019>s,&nbsp; he thought, above the crowd which surrounded her. Yes, she has a flower&nbsp; at her throat; one, two, oh, blessed sight! he saw it all across the&nbsp; room, and gave a rapturous sigh which caused Miss Perry<U+2019>s frizzled crop&nbsp; to wave with a sudden gust. He did not see the rose, for it was&nbsp; hidden by a fold of lace; and it was well, perhaps, that bliss came by&nbsp; instalments, or he might have electrified the assembled multitude by&nbsp; flying to his idol, there being no Daisy to clutch him by the coat-tail.&nbsp; A stout lady, thirsting for information, seized him at that thrilling&nbsp; moment, and he was forced to point out celebrities with a saintly&nbsp; patience which deserved a better reward than it received; for a certain&nbsp; absence of mind and incoherence of speech at times caused the ungrateful&nbsp; dowager to whisper to the first friend she met after he had escaped:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I saw no wine at any of the spreads; but it is plain that young Brooke&nbsp; has had too much. Quite gentlemanly, but evidently a trifle intoxicated,&nbsp; my dear.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, so he was! but with a diviner wine than any that ever sparkled at a&nbsp; class-day lunch, though many collegians know the taste of it; and when&nbsp; the old lady was disposed of, he gladly turned to find the young one,&nbsp; bent on having a single word. He saw her standing by the piano now,&nbsp; idly turning over music as she talked with several gentlemen. Hiding his&nbsp; impatience under an air of scholastic repose, Demi hovered near, ready&nbsp; to advance when the happy moment came, wondering meantime why elderly&nbsp; persons persisted in absorbing young ones instead of sensibly sitting&nbsp; in corners with their contemporaries. The elderly persons in question&nbsp; retired at length, but only to be replaced by two impetuous youths who&nbsp; begged Miss Heath to accompany them to Parnassus and join the dance.&nbsp; Demi thirsted for their blood, but was appeased by hearing George and&nbsp; Dolly say, as they lingered a moment after her refusal:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Really, you know, I<U+2019>m quite converted to co-education and almost wish&nbsp; I<U+2019>d remained here. It gives a grace to study, a sort of relish even to&nbsp; Greek to see charming girls at it,<U+2019> said Stuffy, who found the feast&nbsp; of learning so dry, any sauce was welcome; and he felt as if he had&nbsp; discovered a new one.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, by Jove! we fellows will have to look out or you<U+2019>ll carry off all&nbsp; the honours. You were superb today, and held us all like magic, though&nbsp; it was so hot there, I really think I couldn<U+2019>t have stood it for anyone&nbsp; else,<U+2019> added Dolly, labouring to be gallant and really offering a&nbsp; touching proof of devotion; for the heat melted his collar, took the&nbsp; curl out of his hair, and ruined his gloves.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>There is room for all; and if you will leave us the books, we will&nbsp; cheerfully yield the baseball, boating, dancing, and flirting, which&nbsp; seem to be the branches you prefer,<U+2019> answered Alice sweetly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ah, now you are too hard upon us! We can<U+2019>t grind all the time and you&nbsp; ladies don<U+2019>t seem to mind taking a turn at the two latter <U+201C>branches<U+201D> you&nbsp; mention,<U+2019> returned Dolly, with a glance at George which plainly said, <U+2018>I&nbsp; had her there.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Some of us do in our first years. Later we give up childish things, you&nbsp; see. Don<U+2019>t let me keep you from Parnassus<U+2019>; and a smiling nod dismissed&nbsp; them, smarting under the bitter consciousness of youth.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You got it there, Doll. Better not try to fence with these superior&nbsp; girls. Sure to be routed, horse, foot, and dragoons,<U+2019> said Stuffy,&nbsp; lumbering away, somewhat cross with too many spreads.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>So deuced sarcastic! Don<U+2019>t believe she<U+2019>s much older than we are.&nbsp; Girls grow up quicker, so she needn<U+2019>t put on airs and talk like a&nbsp; grandmother,<U+2019> muttered Dolly, feeling that he had sacrificed his kids&nbsp; upon the altar of an ungrateful Pallas.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come along and let<U+2019>s find something to eat. I<U+2019>m faint with so much&nbsp; talking. Old Plock cornered me and made my head spin with Kant and Hegel&nbsp; and that lot.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I promised Dora West I<U+2019>d give her a turn. Must look her up; she<U+2019>s a&nbsp; jolly little thing, and doesn<U+2019>t bother about anything but keeping in&nbsp; step.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; And arm in arm the boys strolled away, leaving Alice to read music as&nbsp; diligently as if society had indeed no charms for her. As she bent to&nbsp; turn a page, the eager young man behind the piano saw the rose and was&nbsp; struck speechless with delight. A moment he gazed, then hastened to&nbsp; seize the coveted place before a new detachment of bores arrived.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Alice, I can<U+2019>t believe it--did you understand--how shall I ever thank&nbsp; you?<U+2019> murmured Demi, bending as if he, too, read the song, not a note or&nbsp; word of which did he see, however.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Hush! not now. I understood--I don<U+2019>t deserve it--we are too young, we&nbsp; must wait, but--I<U+2019>m very proud and happy, John!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; What would have happened after that tender whisper I tremble to think,&nbsp; if Tom Bangs had not come bustling up, with the cheerful remark:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Music? just the thing. People are thinning out, and we all want a&nbsp; little refreshment. My brain fairly reels with the <U+2018>ologies and <U+2018>isms&nbsp; I<U+2019>ve heard discussed tonight. Yes, give us this; sweet thing! Scotch&nbsp; songs are always charming.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi glowered; but the obtuse boy never saw it, and Alice, feeling that&nbsp; this would be a safe vent for sundry unruly emotions, sat down at once,&nbsp; and sang the song which gave her answer better than she could have done:&nbsp; &nbsp;                 BIDE A WEE&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>The puir auld folk at home, ye mind,&nbsp;     Are frail and failing sair;&nbsp;     And weel I ken they<U+2019>d miss me, lad,&nbsp;     Gin I come hame nae mair.&nbsp;     The grist is out, the times are hard,&nbsp;     The kine are only three;&nbsp;     I canna leave the auld folk now.&nbsp;     We<U+2019>d better bide a wee.&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>I fear me sair they<U+2019>re failing baith;&nbsp;     For when I sit apart,&nbsp;     They talk o<U+2019> Heaven so earnestly,&nbsp;     It well nigh breaks my heart.&nbsp;     So, laddie, dinna urge me now,&nbsp;     It surely winna be;&nbsp;     I canna leave the auld folk yet.&nbsp;     We<U+2019>d better bide a wee.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The room was very still before the first verse ended; and Alice skipped&nbsp; the next, fearing she could not get through; for John<U+2019>s eyes were on&nbsp; her, showing that he knew she sang for him and let the plaintive little&nbsp; ballad tell what her reply must be. He took it as she meant it, and&nbsp; smiled at her so happily that her heart got the better of her voice, and&nbsp; she rose abruptly, saying something about the heat.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, you are tired; come out and rest, my dearest<U+2019>; and with a&nbsp; masterful air Demi took her into the starlight, leaving Tom to stare&nbsp; after them winking as if a sky-rocket had suddenly gone off under his&nbsp; nose.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bless my soul! the Deacon really meant business last summer and never&nbsp; told me. Won<U+2019>t Dora laugh?<U+2019> And Tom departed in hot haste to impart and&nbsp; exult over his discovery.&nbsp; &nbsp; What was said in the garden was never exactly known; but the Brooke&nbsp; family sat up very late that night, and any curious eye at the window&nbsp; would have seen Demi receiving the homage of his womankind as he told&nbsp; his little romance. Josie took great credit to herself in the matter,&nbsp; insisting that she had made the match; Daisy was full of the sweetest&nbsp; sympathy and joy, and Mrs Meg so happy that when Jo had gone to dream&nbsp; of bridal veils, and Demi sat in his room blissfully playing the air of&nbsp; <U+2018>Bide a Wee<U+2019>, she had her talk about Nat, ending with her arms round her&nbsp; dutiful daughter and these welcome words as her reward:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Wait till Nat comes home, and then my good girl shall wear white roses&nbsp; too.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 20. LIFE FOR LIFE&nbsp; &nbsp; The summer days that followed were full of rest and pleasure for young&nbsp; and old, as they did the honours of Plumfield to their happy guests.&nbsp; While Franz and Emil were busy with the affairs of Uncle Hermann and&nbsp; Captain Hardy, Mary and Ludmilla made friends everywhere; for, though&nbsp; very unlike, both were excellent and charming girls. Mrs Meg and Daisy&nbsp; found the German bride a Hausfrau after their own hearts, and had&nbsp; delightful times learning new dishes, hearing about the semi-yearly&nbsp; washes and the splendid linen-room at Hamburg, or discussing domestic&nbsp; life in all its branches. Ludmilla not only taught, but learned, many&nbsp; things, and went home with many new and useful ideas in her blonde head.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mary had seen so much of the world that she was unusually lively for&nbsp; an English girl; while her various accomplishments made her a most&nbsp; agreeable companion. Much good sense gave her ballast; and the late&nbsp; experiences of danger and happiness added a sweet gravity at times,&nbsp; which contrasted well with her natural gaiety. Mrs Jo was quite&nbsp; satisfied with Emil<U+2019>s choice, and felt sure this true and tender pilot&nbsp; would bring him safe to port through fair or stormy weather. She had&nbsp; feared that Franz would settle down into a comfortable, moneymaking&nbsp; burgher, and be content with that; but she soon saw that his love of&nbsp; music and his placid Ludmilla put much poetry into his busy life, and&nbsp; kept it from being too prosaic. So she felt at rest about these boys,&nbsp; and enjoyed their visit with real, maternal satisfaction; parting with&nbsp; them in September most regretfully, yet hopefully, as they sailed away&nbsp; to the new life that lay before them.&nbsp; &nbsp; Demi<U+2019>s engagement was confided to the immediate family only, as both&nbsp; were pronounced too young to do anything but love and wait. They were&nbsp; so happy that time seemed to stand still for them, and after a blissful&nbsp; week they parted bravely--Alice to home duties, with a hope that&nbsp; sustained and cheered her through many trials; and John to his business,&nbsp; full of a new ardour which made all things possible when such a reward&nbsp; was offered.&nbsp; &nbsp; Daisy rejoiced over them, and was never tired of hearing her brother<U+2019>s&nbsp; plans for the future. Her own hope soon made her what she used to be--a&nbsp; cheery, busy creature, with a smile, kind word, and helping hand for&nbsp; all; and as she went singing about the house again, her mother felt that&nbsp; the right remedy for past sadness had been found. The dear Pelican still&nbsp; had doubts and fears, but kept them wisely to herself, preparing sundry&nbsp; searching tests to be applied when Nat came home, and keeping a sharp&nbsp; eye on the letters from London; for some mysterious hint had flown&nbsp; across the sea, and Daisy<U+2019>s content seemed reflected in Nat<U+2019>s present&nbsp; cheerful state of mind.&nbsp; &nbsp; Having passed through the Werther period, and tried a little Faust--of&nbsp; which experience he spoke to his Marguerite as if it had included&nbsp; an acquaintance with Mephistopheles, Blocksburg, and Auerbach<U+2019>s&nbsp; wine-cellar--he now felt that he was a Wilhelm Meister, serving his&nbsp; apprenticeship to the great masters of life. As she knew the truth of&nbsp; his small sins and honest repentance, Daisy only smiled at the mixture&nbsp; of love and philosophy he sent her, knowing that it was impossible for a&nbsp; young man to live in Germany without catching the German spirit.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>His heart is all right; and his head will soon grow clear when he gets&nbsp; out of the fog of tobacco, beer, and metaphysics he<U+2019>s been living in.&nbsp; England will wake up his common sense, and good salt air blow his little&nbsp; follies all away,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, much pleased with the good prospects&nbsp; of her violinist--whose return was delayed till spring, to his private&nbsp; regret, but professional advancement.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie had a month with Miss Cameron at the seaside, and threw herself&nbsp; so heartily into the lesson given her that her energy, promise, and&nbsp; patience laid the foundation of a friendship which was of infinite value&nbsp; to her in the busy, brilliant years to come; for little Jo<U+2019>s instincts&nbsp; were right; and the dramatic talent of the Marches was to blossom by and&nbsp; by into an actress, virtuous, and beloved.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tom and his Dora were peacefully ambling altar-ward; for Bangs senior&nbsp; was so afraid his son would change his mind again and try a third&nbsp; profession, that he gladly consented to an early marriage, as a sort&nbsp; of anchor to hold the mercurial Thomas fast. Aforesaid Thomas could not&nbsp; complain of cold shoulders now; for Dora was a most devoted and adoring&nbsp; little mate, and made life so pleasant to him that his gift for getting&nbsp; into scrapes seemed lost, and he bade fair to become a thriving man,&nbsp; with undeniable talent for the business he had chosen.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We shall be married in the autumn, and live with my father for a while.&nbsp; The governor is getting on, you know, and my wife and I must look after&nbsp; him. Later we shall have an establishment of our own,<U+2019> was a favourite&nbsp; speech of his about this time, and usually received with smiles; for the&nbsp; idea of Tommy Bangs at the head of an <U+2018>establishment<U+2019> was irresistibly&nbsp; funny to all who knew him.&nbsp; &nbsp; Things were in this flourishing condition, and Mrs Jo was beginning to&nbsp; think her trials were over for that year, when a new excitement came.&nbsp; Several postal cards had arrived at long intervals from Dan, who gave&nbsp; them <U+2018>Care of M. Mason, etc.<U+2019>, as his address. By this means he was&nbsp; able to gratify his longing for home news, and to send brief messages to&nbsp; quiet their surprise at his delay in settling. The last one, which came&nbsp; in September, was dated <U+2018>Montana<U+2019>, and simply said:&nbsp; &nbsp; Here at last, trying mining again; but not going to stay long. All sorts&nbsp; of luck. Gave up the farm idea. Tell plans soon. Well, busy, and very&nbsp; happy. D. K.&nbsp; &nbsp; If they had known what the heavy dash under <U+2018>happy<U+2019> meant, that postal&nbsp; would have been a very eloquent bit of pasteboard; for Dan was free,&nbsp; and had gone straight away to the liberty he panted for. Meeting an old&nbsp; friend by accident, he obliged him at a pinch by acting as overseer&nbsp; for a time, finding the society even of rough miners very sweet, and&nbsp; something in the muscular work wonderfully pleasant, after being cooped&nbsp; up in the brush-shop so long. He loved to take a pick and wrestle with&nbsp; rock and earth till he was weary--which was very soon; for that year of&nbsp; captivity had told upon his splendid physique. He longed to go home, but&nbsp; waited week after week to get the prison taint off him and the haggard&nbsp; look out of his face. Meanwhile he made friends of masters and men;&nbsp; and as no one knew his story, he took his place again in the world&nbsp; gratefully and gladly--with little pride now, and no plans but to do&nbsp; some good somewhere, and efface the past.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo was having a grand clearing-out of her desk one October day,&nbsp; while the rain poured outside, and peace reigned in her mansion. Coming&nbsp; across the postals, she pondered over them, and then put them carefully&nbsp; away in the drawer labelled <U+2018>Boys<U+2019> Letters<U+2019>, saying to herself, as she&nbsp; bundled eleven requests for autographs into the waste-paper basket:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is quite time for another card, unless he is coming to tell his&nbsp; plans. I<U+2019>m really curious to know what he has been about all this year,&nbsp; and how he<U+2019>s getting on now.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; That last wish was granted within an hour; for Ted came rushing in, with&nbsp; a newspaper in one hand, a collapsed umbrella in the other, and a face&nbsp; full of excitement, announcing, all in one breathless jumble:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mine caved in--twenty men shut up--no way out--wives crying--water&nbsp; rising--Dan knew the old shaft--risked his life--got <U+2018>em out--most&nbsp; killed--papers full of it--I knew he<U+2019>d be a hero--hurray for old Dan!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What? Where? When? Who? Stop roaring, and let me read!<U+2019> commanded his&nbsp; mother, entirely bewildered.&nbsp; &nbsp; Relinquishing the paper, Ted allowed her to read for herself, with&nbsp; frequent interruptions from him--and Rob, who soon followed, eager&nbsp; for the tale. It was nothing new; but courage and devotion always stir&nbsp; generous hearts, and win admiration; so the account was both graphic and&nbsp; enthusiastic; and the name of Daniel Kean, the brave man who saved the&nbsp; lives of others at the risk of his own, was on many lips that day. Very&nbsp; proud were the faces of these friends as they read how their Dan was&nbsp; the only one who, in the first panic of the accident, remembered the old&nbsp; shaft that led into the mine--walled up, but the only hope of escape,&nbsp; if the men could be got out before the rising water drowned them; how he&nbsp; was lowered down alone, telling the others to keep back till he saw if&nbsp; it was safe; how he heard the poor fellows picking desperately for their&nbsp; lives on the other side, and by knocks and calls guided them to the&nbsp; right spot; then headed the rescue party, and working like a hero, got&nbsp; the men out in time. On being drawn up last of all, the worn rope broke,&nbsp; and he had a terrible fall, being much hurt, but was still alive. How&nbsp; the grateful women kissed his blackened face and bloody hands, as the&nbsp; men bore him away in triumph, and the owners of the mine promised a&nbsp; handsome reward, if he lived to receive it!&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He must live; he shall, and come home to be nursed as soon as he can&nbsp; stir, if I go and bring him myself! I always knew he<U+2019>d do something fine&nbsp; and brave, if he didn<U+2019>t get shot or hung for some wild prank instead,<U+2019>&nbsp; cried Mrs Jo, much excited.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Do go, and take me with you, Mum. I ought to be the one, Dan<U+2019>s so fond&nbsp; of me and I of him,<U+2019> began Ted, feeling that this would be an expedition&nbsp; after his own heart.&nbsp; &nbsp; Before his mother could reply, Mr Laurie came in, with almost as much&nbsp; noise and flurry as Teddy the second, exclaiming as he waved the evening&nbsp; paper:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Seen the news, Jo? What do you think? Shall I go off at once, and see&nbsp; after that brave boy?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I wish you would. But the thing may not be all true--rumour lies so.&nbsp; Perhaps a few hours will bring an entirely new version of the story.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve telephoned to Demi for all he can find out; and if it<U+2019>s true, I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; go at once. Should like the trip. If he<U+2019>s able, I<U+2019>ll bring him home; if&nbsp; not, I<U+2019>ll stay and see to him. He<U+2019>ll pull through. Dan will never die of&nbsp; a fall on his head. He<U+2019>s got nine lives, and not lost half of them yet.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If you go, uncle, mayn<U+2019>t I go with you? I<U+2019>m just spoiling for a&nbsp; journey; and it would be such larks to go out there with you, and see&nbsp; the mines and Dan, and hear all about it, and help. I can nurse. Can<U+2019>t&nbsp; I, Rob?<U+2019> cried Teddy, in his most wheedlesome tones.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Pretty well. But if mother can<U+2019>t spare you, I<U+2019>m ready if uncle needs&nbsp; anyone,<U+2019> answered Rob, in his quiet way, looking much fitter for the&nbsp; trip than excitable Ted.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I can<U+2019>t spare either of you. My boys get into trouble, unless I keep&nbsp; them close at home. I<U+2019>ve no right to hold the others; but I won<U+2019>t let&nbsp; you out of my sight, or something will happen. Never saw such a year,&nbsp; with wrecks and weddings and floods and engagements, and every sort of&nbsp; catastrophe!<U+2019> exclaimed Mrs Jo.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>If you deal in girls and boys, you must expect this sort of thing,&nbsp; ma<U+2019>am. The worst is over, I hope, till these lads begin to go off. Then&nbsp; I<U+2019>ll stand by you; for you<U+2019>ll need every kind of support and comfort,&nbsp; specially if Ted bolts early,<U+2019> laughed Mr Laurie, enjoying her&nbsp; lamentations.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I don<U+2019>t think anything can surprise me now; but I am anxious about&nbsp; Dan, and feel that someone had better go to him. It<U+2019>s a rough place out&nbsp; there, and he may need careful nursing. Poor lad, he seems to get a good&nbsp; many hard knocks! But perhaps he needs them as <U+201C>a mellerin<U+2019> process<U+201D>, as&nbsp; Hannah used to say.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>We shall hear from Demi before long, and then I<U+2019>ll be off.<U+2019> With which&nbsp; cheerful promise Mr Laurie departed; and Ted, finding his mother firm,&nbsp; soon followed, to coax his uncle to take him.&nbsp; &nbsp; Further inquiry confirmed and added interest to the news. Mr Laurie was&nbsp; off at once; and Ted went into town with him, still vainly imploring to&nbsp; be taken to his Dan. He was absent all day; but his mother said, calmly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Only a fit of the sulks because he is thwarted. He<U+2019>s safe with Tom or&nbsp; Demi, and will come home hungry and meek at night. I know him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; But she soon found that she could still be surprised; for evening&nbsp; brought no Ted, and no one had seen him. Mr Bhaer was just setting&nbsp; off to find his lost son, when a telegram arrived, dated at one of the&nbsp; way-stations on Mr Laurie<U+2019>s route:&nbsp; &nbsp;     Found Ted in the cars. Take him along. Write tomorrow.&nbsp; &nbsp;         T.  LAURENCE&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ted bolted sooner than you expected, mother. Never mind--uncle will&nbsp; take good care of him, and Dan be very glad to see him,<U+2019> said Rob, as&nbsp; Mrs Jo sat, trying to realize that her youngest was actually on his way&nbsp; to the wild West.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Disobedient boy! He shall be severely punished, if I ever get him&nbsp; again. Laurie winked at this prank; I know he did. Just like him.&nbsp; Won<U+2019>t the two rascals have a splendid time? Wish I was with them! Don<U+2019>t&nbsp; believe that crazy boy took even a night-gown with him, or an overcoat.&nbsp; Well, there will be two patients for us to nurse when they get back, if&nbsp; they ever do. Those reckless express trains always go down precipices,&nbsp; and burn up, or telescope. Oh! my Ted, my precious boy, how can I let&nbsp; him go so far away from me?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; And mother-like, Mrs Jo forgot the threatened chastisement in tender&nbsp; lamentations over the happy scapegrace, now whizzing across the&nbsp; continent in high feather at the success of his first revolt. Mr Laurie&nbsp; was much amused at his insisting that those words, <U+2018>when Ted bolts<U+2019>, put&nbsp; the idea into his head; and therefore the responsibility rested upon his&nbsp; shoulders. He assumed it kindly from the moment he came upon the runaway&nbsp; asleep in a car, with no visible luggage but a bottle of wine for Dan&nbsp; and a blacking-brush for himself; and as Mrs Jo suspected, the <U+2018>two&nbsp; rascals<U+2019> did have a splendid time. Penitent letters arrived in due&nbsp; season, and the irate parents soon forgot to chide in their anxiety&nbsp; about Dan, who was very ill, and did not know his friends for several&nbsp; days. Then he began to mend; and everyone forgave the bad boy when he&nbsp; proudly reported that the first conscious words Dan said were: <U+2018>Hallo,&nbsp; Ted!<U+2019> with a smile of pleasure at seeing a familiar face bent over him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Glad he went, and I won<U+2019>t scold any more. Now, what shall we put in the&nbsp; box for Dan?<U+2019> And Mrs Jo worked off her impatience to get hold of the&nbsp; invalid by sending comforts enough for a hospital.&nbsp; &nbsp; Cheering accounts soon began to come, and at length Dan was pronounced&nbsp; able to travel, but seemed in no haste to go home, though never tired of&nbsp; hearing his nurses talk of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Dan is strangely altered,<U+2019> wrote Laurie to Jo; <U+2018>not by this illness&nbsp; alone, but by something which has evidently gone before. I don<U+2019>t know&nbsp; what, and leave you to ask; but from his ravings when delirious I fear&nbsp; he has been in some serious trouble the past year. He seems ten years&nbsp; older, but improved, quieter, and so grateful to us. It is pathetic to&nbsp; see the hunger in his eyes as they rest on Ted, as if he couldn<U+2019>t see&nbsp; enough of him. He says Kansas was a failure, but can<U+2019>t talk much; so I&nbsp; bide my time. The people here love him very much, and he cares for that&nbsp; sort of thing now; used to scorn any show of emotion, you know; now&nbsp; he wants everyone to think well of him, and can<U+2019>t do enough to win&nbsp; affection and respect. I may be all wrong. You will soon find out. Ted&nbsp; is in clover, and the trip has done him a world of good. Let me take him&nbsp; to Europe when we go? Apron-strings don<U+2019>t agree with him any better than&nbsp; they did with me when I proposed to run away to Washington with you some&nbsp; century ago. Aren<U+2019>t you sorry you didn<U+2019>t?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; This private letter set Mrs Jo<U+2019>s lively fancy in a ferment, and she&nbsp; imagined every known crime, affliction, and complication which could&nbsp; possibly have befallen Dan. He was too feeble to be worried with&nbsp; questions now, but she promised herself most interesting revelations&nbsp; when she got him safe at home; for the <U+2018>firebrand<U+2019> was her most&nbsp; interesting boy. She begged him to come, and spent more time in&nbsp; composing a letter that should bring him, than she did over the most&nbsp; thrilling episodes in her <U+2018>works<U+2019>.&nbsp; &nbsp; No one but Dan saw the letter; but it did bring him, and one November&nbsp; day Mr Laurie helped a feeble man out of a carriage at the door of&nbsp; Plumfield, and Mother Bhaer received the wanderer like a recovered son;&nbsp; while Ted, in a disreputable-looking hat and an astonishing pair of&nbsp; boots, performed a sort of war-dance round the interesting group.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Right upstairs and rest; I<U+2019>m nurse now, and this ghost must eat before&nbsp; he talks to anyone,<U+2019> commanded Mrs Jo, trying not to show how shocked&nbsp; she was at this shorn and shaven, gaunt and pallid shadow of the&nbsp; stalwart man she parted with.&nbsp; &nbsp; He was quite content to obey, and lay on the long lounge in the room&nbsp; prepared for him, looking about as tranquilly as a sick child restored&nbsp; to its own nursery and mother<U+2019>s arms, while his new nurse fed and&nbsp; refreshed him, bravely controlling the questions that burned upon her&nbsp; tongue. Being weak and weary, he soon fell asleep; and then she stole&nbsp; away to enjoy the society of the <U+2018>rascals<U+2019>, whom she scolded and petted,&nbsp; pumped and praised, to her heart<U+2019>s content.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Jo, I think Dan has committed some crime and suffered for it,<U+2019> said Mr&nbsp; Laurie, when Ted had departed to show his boots and tell glowing tales&nbsp; of the dangers and delights of the miners<U+2019> life to his mates. <U+2018>Some&nbsp; terrible experience has come to the lad, and broken his spirit. He was&nbsp; quite out of his head when we arrived, and I took the watching, so I&nbsp; heard more of those sad wanderings than anyone else. He talked of the&nbsp; <U+201C>warden<U+201D>, some trail, a dead man, and Blair and Mason, and would keep&nbsp; offering me his hand, asking me if I would take it and forgive him.&nbsp; Once, when he was very wild, I held his arms, and he quieted in a&nbsp; moment, imploring me not to <U+201C>put the handcuffs on<U+201D>. I declare, it was&nbsp; quite awful sometimes to hear him in the night talk of old Plum and you,&nbsp; and beg to be let out and go home to die.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He isn<U+2019>t going to die, but live to repent of anything he may have done;&nbsp; so don<U+2019>t harrow me up with these dark hints, Teddy. I don<U+2019>t care if he<U+2019>s&nbsp; broken the Ten Commandments, I<U+2019>ll stand by him, and so will you, and&nbsp; we<U+2019>ll set him on his feet and make a good man of him yet. I know he<U+2019>s&nbsp; not spoilt, by the look in his poor face. Don<U+2019>t say a word to anyone,&nbsp; and I<U+2019>ll have the truth before long,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, still loyal to&nbsp; her bad boy, though much afflicted by what she had heard.&nbsp; &nbsp; For some days Dan rested, and saw few people; then good care, cheerful&nbsp; surroundings, and the comfort of being at home began to tell, and&nbsp; he seemed more like himself, though still very silent as to his late&nbsp; experiences, pleading the doctor<U+2019>s orders not to talk much. Everyone&nbsp; wanted to see him; but he shrank from any but old friends, and <U+2018>wouldn<U+2019>t&nbsp; lionize worth a cent<U+2019>, Ted said, much disappointed that he could not&nbsp; show off his brave Dan.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Wasn<U+2019>t a man there who wouldn<U+2019>t have done the same, so why make a row&nbsp; over me?<U+2019> asked the hero, feeling more ashamed than proud of the broken&nbsp; arm, which looked so interesting in a sling.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But isn<U+2019>t it pleasant to think that you saved twenty lives, Dan, and&nbsp; gave husbands, sons, and fathers back to the women who loved them?<U+2019>&nbsp; asked Mrs Jo one evening as they were alone together after several&nbsp; callers had been sent away.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Pleasant! it<U+2019>s all that kept me alive, I do believe; yes, I<U+2019>d rather&nbsp; have done it than be made president or any other big bug in the world.&nbsp; No one knows what a comfort it is to think I<U+2019>ve saved twenty men to more&nbsp; than pay for--<U+2019> There Dan stopped short, having evidently spoken out of&nbsp; some strong emotion to which his hearer had no key.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I thought you<U+2019>d feel so. It is a splendid thing to save life at the&nbsp; risk of one<U+2019>s own, as you did, and nearly lose it,<U+2019> began Mrs Jo,&nbsp; wishing he had gone on with that impulsive speech which was so like his&nbsp; old manner.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018><U+201C>He that loseth his life shall gain it<U+201D>,<U+2019> muttered Dan, staring at the&nbsp; cheerful fire which lighted the room, and shone on his thin face with a&nbsp; ruddy glow.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo was so startled at hearing such words from his lips that she&nbsp; exclaimed joyfully:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Then you did read the little book I gave you, and kept your promise?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I read it a good deal after a while. I don<U+2019>t know much yet, but I<U+2019>m&nbsp; ready to learn; and that<U+2019>s something.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s everything. Oh, my dear, tell me about it! I know something lies&nbsp; heavy on your heart; let me help you bear it, and so make the burden&nbsp; lighter.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know it would; I want to tell; but some things even you couldn<U+2019>t&nbsp; forgive; and if you let go of me, I<U+2019>m afraid I can<U+2019>t keep afloat.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mothers can forgive anything! Tell me all, and be sure that I will&nbsp; never let you go, though the whole world should turn from you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo took one of the big wasted hands in both of hers and held it&nbsp; fast, waiting silently till that sustaining touch warmed poor Dan<U+2019>s&nbsp; heart, and gave him courage to speak. Sitting in his old attitude, with&nbsp; his head in his hands, he slowly told it all, never once looking up till&nbsp; the last words left his lips.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now you know; can you forgive a murderer, and keep a jail-bird in your&nbsp; house?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Her only answer was to put her arms about him, and lay the shorn head on&nbsp; her breast, with eyes so full of tears they could but dimly see the hope&nbsp; and fear that made his own so tragical.&nbsp; &nbsp; That was better than any words; and poor Dan clung to her in speechless&nbsp; gratitude, feeling the blessedness of mother love--that divine gift&nbsp; which comforts, purifies, and strengthens all who seek it. Two or three&nbsp; great, bitter drops were hidden in the little woollen shawl where Dan<U+2019>s&nbsp; cheek rested, and no one ever knew how soft and comfortable it felt to&nbsp; him after the hard pillows he had known so long. Suffering of both mind&nbsp; and body had broken will and pride, and the lifted burden brought such a&nbsp; sense of relief that he paused a moment to enjoy it in dumb delight.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>My poor boy, how you have suffered all this year, when we thought you&nbsp; free as air! Why didn<U+2019>t you tell us, Dan, and let us help you? Did you&nbsp; doubt your friends?<U+2019> asked Mrs Jo, forgetting all other emotions in&nbsp; sympathy, as she lifted up the hidden face, and looked reproachfully&nbsp; into the great hollow eyes that met her own frankly now.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I was ashamed. I tried to bear it alone rather than shock and&nbsp; disappoint you, as I know I have, though you try not to show it. Don<U+2019>t&nbsp; mind; I must get used to it<U+2019>; and Dan<U+2019>s eyes dropped again as if they&nbsp; could not bear to see the trouble and dismay his confession painted on&nbsp; his best friend<U+2019>s face.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I am shocked and disappointed by the sin, but I am also very glad and&nbsp; proud and grateful that my sinner has repented, atoned, and is ready to&nbsp; profit by the bitter lesson. No one but Fritz and Laurie need ever know&nbsp; the truth; we owe it to them, and they will feel as I do,<U+2019> answered Mrs&nbsp; Jo, wisely thinking that entire frankness would be a better tonic than&nbsp; too much sympathy.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, they won<U+2019>t; men never forgive like women. But it<U+2019>s right. Please&nbsp; tell <U+2018>em for me, and get it over. Mr Laurence knows it, I guess. I&nbsp; blabbed when my wits were gone; but he was very kind all the same. I can&nbsp; bear their knowing; but oh, not Ted and the girls!<U+2019> Dan clutched her&nbsp; arm with such an imploring face that she hastened to assure him no one&nbsp; should know except the two old friends, and he calmed down as if ashamed&nbsp; of his sudden panic.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It wasn<U+2019>t murder, mind you, it was in self-defence; he drew first, and&nbsp; I had to hit him. Didn<U+2019>t mean to kill him; but it doesn<U+2019>t worry me as&nbsp; much as it ought, I<U+2019>m afraid. I<U+2019>ve more than paid for it, and such a&nbsp; rascal is better out of the world than in it, showing boys the way to&nbsp; hell. Yes, I know you think that<U+2019>s awful in me; but I can<U+2019>t help it. I&nbsp; hate a scamp as I do a skulking coyote, and always want to get a shot at&nbsp; <U+2018>em. Perhaps it would have been better if he had killed me; my life is&nbsp; spoilt.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; All the old prison gloom seemed to settle like a black cloud on Dan<U+2019>s&nbsp; face as he spoke, and Mrs Jo was frightened at the glimpse it gave her&nbsp; of the fire through which he had passed to come out alive, but&nbsp; scarred for life. Hoping to turn his mind to happier things, she said&nbsp; cheerfully:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, it isn<U+2019>t; you have learned to value it more and use it better&nbsp; for this trial. It is not a lost year, but one that may prove the most&nbsp; helpful of any you ever know. Try to think so, and begin again; we will&nbsp; help, and have all the more confidence in you for this failure. We all&nbsp; do the same and struggle on.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I never can be what I was. I feel about sixty, and don<U+2019>t care for&nbsp; anything now I<U+2019>ve got here. Let me stay till I<U+2019>m on my legs, then I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; clear out and never trouble you any more,<U+2019> said Dan despondently.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are weak and low in your mind; that will pass, and by and by you&nbsp; will go to your missionary work among the Indians with all the old&nbsp; energy and the new patience, self-control, and knowledge you have&nbsp; gained. Tell me more about that good chaplain and Mary Mason and the&nbsp; lady whose chance word helped you so much. I want to know all about the&nbsp; trials of my poor boy.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Won by her tender interest, Dan brightened up and talked on till he had&nbsp; poured out all the story of that bitter year, and felt better for the&nbsp; load he lifted off.&nbsp; &nbsp; If he had known how it weighed upon his hearer<U+2019>s heart, he would have&nbsp; held his peace; but she hid her sorrow till she had sent him to bed,&nbsp; comforted and calm; then she cried her heart out, to the great dismay&nbsp; of Fritz and Laurie, till they heard the tale and could mourn with her;&nbsp; after which they all cheered up and took counsel together how best to&nbsp; help this worst of all the <U+2018>catastrophes<U+2019> the year had brought them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 21. ASLAUGA<U+2019>S KNIGHT&nbsp; &nbsp; It was curious to see the change which came over Dan after that talk. A&nbsp; weight seemed off his mind; and though the old impetuous spirit flashed&nbsp; out at times, he seemed intent on trying to show his gratitude and love&nbsp; and honour to these true friends by a new humility and confidence very&nbsp; sweet to them, very helpful to him. After hearing the story from Mrs&nbsp; Jo, the Professor and Mr Laurie made no allusion to it beyond the hearty&nbsp; hand-grasp, the look of compassion, the brief word of good cheer in&nbsp; which men convey sympathy, and a redoubled kindness which left no doubt&nbsp; of pardon. Mr Laurie began at once to interest influential persons&nbsp; in Dan<U+2019>s mission, and set in motion the machinery which needs so much&nbsp; oiling before anything can be done where Government is concerned.&nbsp; Mr Bhaer, with the skill of a true teacher, gave Dan<U+2019>s hungry mind&nbsp; something to do, and helped him understand himself by carrying on the&nbsp; good chaplain<U+2019>s task so paternally that the poor fellow often said he&nbsp; felt as if he had found a father. The boys took him to drive, and amused&nbsp; him with their pranks and plans; while the women, old and young, nursed&nbsp; and petted him till he felt like a sultan with a crowd of devoted&nbsp; slaves, obedient to his lightest wish. A very little of this was enough&nbsp; for Dan, who had a masculine horror of <U+2018>molly-coddling<U+2019>, and so brief an&nbsp; acquaintance with illness that he rebelled against the doctor<U+2019>s orders&nbsp; to keep quiet; and it took all Mrs Jo<U+2019>s authority and the girls<U+2019>&nbsp; ingenuity to keep him from leaving his sofa long before strained back&nbsp; and wounded head were well. Daisy cooked for him; Nan attended to his&nbsp; medicines; Josie read aloud to while away the long hours of inaction&nbsp; that hung so heavily on his hands; while Bess brought all her&nbsp; pictures and casts to amuse him, and, at his special desire, set up a&nbsp; modelling-stand in his parlour and began to mould the buffalo head he&nbsp; gave her. Those afternoons seemed the pleasantest part of his day; and&nbsp; Mrs Jo, busy in her study close by, could see the friendly trio and&nbsp; enjoy the pretty pictures they made. The girls were much flattered&nbsp; by the success of their efforts, and exerted themselves to be very&nbsp; entertaining, consulting Dan<U+2019>s moods with the feminine tact most women&nbsp; creatures learn before they are out of pinafores. When he was gay, the&nbsp; room rang with laughter; when gloomy, they read or worked in respectful&nbsp; silence till their sweet patience cheered him up again; and when in pain&nbsp; they hovered over him like <U+2018>a couple of angels<U+2019>, as he said. He often&nbsp; called Josie <U+2018>little mother<U+2019>, but Bess was always <U+2018>Princess<U+2019>; and his&nbsp; manner to the two cousins was quite different. Josie sometimes fretted&nbsp; him with her fussy ways, the long plays she liked to read, and the&nbsp; maternal scoldings she administered when he broke the rules; for having&nbsp; a lord of creation in her power was so delightful to her that she would&nbsp; have ruled him with a rod of iron if he had submitted. To Bess, in her&nbsp; gentler ministrations, he never showed either impatience or weariness,&nbsp; but obeyed her least word, exerted himself to seem well in her presence,&nbsp; and took such interest in her work that he lay looking at her with&nbsp; unwearied eyes; while Josie read to him in her best style unheeded.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo observed this, and called them <U+2018>Una and the Lion<U+2019>, which suited&nbsp; them very well, though the lion<U+2019>s mane was shorn, and Una never tried to&nbsp; bridle him. The elder ladies did their part in providing delicacies and&nbsp; supplying all his wants; but Mrs Meg was busy at home, Mrs Amy preparing&nbsp; for the trip to Europe in the spring, and Mrs Jo hovering on the brink&nbsp; of a <U+2018>vortex<U+2019>--for the forthcoming book had been sadly delayed by&nbsp; the late domestic events. As she sat at her desk, settling papers or&nbsp; meditatively nibbling her pen while waiting for the divine afflatus to&nbsp; descend upon her, she often forgot her fictitious heroes and heroines&nbsp; in studying the live models before her, and thus by chance looks, words,&nbsp; and gestures discovered a little romance unsuspected by anyone else.&nbsp; &nbsp; The portiere between the rooms was usually drawn aside, giving a view of&nbsp; the group in the large bay-window--Bess at one side, in her grey blouse,&nbsp; busy with her tools; Josie at the other side with her book; and between,&nbsp; on the long couch, propped with many cushions, lay Dan in a many-hued&nbsp; eastern dressing-gown presented by Mr Laurie and worn to please&nbsp; the girls, though the invalid much preferred an old jacket <U+2018>with no&nbsp; confounded tail to bother over<U+2019>. He faced Mrs Jo<U+2019>s room, but never&nbsp; seemed to see her, for his eyes were on the slender figure before him,&nbsp; with the pale winter sunshine touching her golden head, and the delicate&nbsp; hands that shaped the clay so deftly. Josie was just visible, rocking&nbsp; violently in a little chair at the head of the couch, and the steady&nbsp; murmur of her girlish voice was usually the only sound that broke the&nbsp; quiet of the room, unless a sudden discussion arose about the book or&nbsp; the buffalo.&nbsp; &nbsp; Something in the big eyes, bigger and blacker than ever in the thin&nbsp; white face, fixed, so steadily on one object, had a sort of fascination&nbsp; for Mrs Jo after a time, and she watched the changes in them curiously;&nbsp; for Dan<U+2019>s mind was evidently not on the story, and he often forgot to&nbsp; laugh or exclaim at the comic or exciting crises. Sometimes they were&nbsp; soft and wistful, and the watcher was very glad that neither damsel&nbsp; caught that dangerous look for when they spoke it vanished; sometimes&nbsp; it was full of eager fire, and the colour came and went rebelliously,&nbsp; in spite of his attempt to hide it with an impatient gesture of hand or&nbsp; head; but oftenest it was dark, and sad, and stern, as if those gloomy&nbsp; eyes looked out of captivity at some forbidden light or joy. This&nbsp; expression came so often that it worried Mrs Jo, and she longed to go&nbsp; and ask him what bitter memory overshadowed those quiet hours. She knew&nbsp; that his crime and its punishment must lie heavy on his mind; but youth,&nbsp; and time, and new hopes would bring comfort, and help to wear away&nbsp; the first sharpness of the prison brand. It lifted at other times, and&nbsp; seemed almost forgotten when he joked with the boys, talked with old&nbsp; friends, or enjoyed the first snows as he drove out every fair day. Why&nbsp; should the shadow always fall so darkly on him in the society of these&nbsp; innocent and friendly girls? They never seemed to see it, and if either&nbsp; looked or spoke, a quick smile came like a sunburst through the clouds&nbsp; to answer them. So Mrs Jo went on watching, wondering, and discovering,&nbsp; till accident confirmed her fears.&nbsp; &nbsp; Josie was called away one day, and Bess, tired of working, offered to&nbsp; take her place if he cared for more reading.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I do; your reading suits me better than Jo<U+2019>s. She goes so fast my&nbsp; stupid head gets in a muddle and soon begins to ache. Don<U+2019>t tell her;&nbsp; she<U+2019>s a dear little soul, and so good to sit here with a bear like me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The smile was ready as Bess went to the table for a new book, the last&nbsp; story being finished.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are not a bear, but very good and patient, we think. It is always&nbsp; hard for a man to be shut up, mamma says, and must be terrible for you,&nbsp; who have always been so free.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; If Bess had not been reading titles she would have seen Dan shrink as&nbsp; if her last words hurt him. He made no answer; but other eyes saw and&nbsp; understood why he looked as if he would have liked to spring up and rush&nbsp; away for one of his long races up the hill, as he used to do when the&nbsp; longing for liberty grew uncontrollable. Moved by a sudden impulse, Mrs&nbsp; Jo caught up her work-basket and went to join her neighbours, feeling&nbsp; that a non-conductor might be needed; for Dan looked like a thundercloud&nbsp; full of electricity.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What shall we read, Aunty? Dan doesn<U+2019>t seem to care. You know his&nbsp; taste; tell me something quiet and pleasant and short. Josie will&nbsp; be back soon,<U+2019> said Bess, still turning over the books piled on the&nbsp; centre-table.&nbsp; &nbsp; Before Mrs Jo could answer, Dan pulled a shabby little volume from under&nbsp; his pillow, and handing it to her said: <U+2018>Please read the third one; it<U+2019>s&nbsp; short and pretty--I<U+2019>m fond of it.<U+2019> The book opened at the right place,&nbsp; as if the third story had been often read, and Bess smiled as she saw&nbsp; the name.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Why, Dan, I shouldn<U+2019>t think you<U+2019>d care for this romantic German tale.&nbsp; There is fighting in it; but it is very sentimental, if I remember&nbsp; rightly.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I know it; but I<U+2019>ve read so few stories, I like the simple ones best.&nbsp; Had nothing else to read sometimes; I guess I know it all by heart, and&nbsp; never seem to be tired of those fighting fellows, and the fiends and&nbsp; angels and lovely ladies. You read <U+201C>Aslauga<U+2019>s Knight<U+201D>, and see if you&nbsp; don<U+2019>t like it. Edwald was rather too soft for my fancy; but Froda was&nbsp; first-rate and the spirit with the golden hair always reminded me of&nbsp; you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As Dan spoke Mrs Jo settled herself where she could watch him in the&nbsp; glass, and Bess took a large chair facing him, saying, as she put up her&nbsp; hands to retie the ribbon that held the cluster of thick, soft curls at&nbsp; the back of her head:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I hope Aslauga<U+2019>s hair wasn<U+2019>t as troublesome as mine, for it<U+2019>s always&nbsp; tumbling down. I<U+2019>ll be ready in a minute.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t tie it up; please let it hang. I love to see it shine that way.&nbsp; It will rest your head, and be just right for the story, Goldilocks,<U+2019>&nbsp; pleaded Dan, using the childish name and looking more like his boyish&nbsp; self than he had done for many a day.&nbsp; &nbsp; Bess laughed, shook down her pretty hair, and began to read, glad to&nbsp; hide her face a little; for compliments made her shy, no matter who paid&nbsp; them. Dan listened intently on; and Mrs Jo, with eyes that went often&nbsp; from her needle to the glass, could see, without turning, how he&nbsp; enjoyed every word as if it had more meaning for him than for the other&nbsp; listeners. His face brightened wonderfully, and soon wore the look that&nbsp; came when anything brave or beautiful inspired and touched his better&nbsp; self. It was Fouque<U+2019>s charming story of the knight Froda, and the fair&nbsp; daughter of Sigurd, who was a sort of spirit, appearing to her lover in&nbsp; hours of danger and trial, as well as triumph and joy, till she became&nbsp; his guide and guard, inspiring him with courage, nobleness, and truth,&nbsp; leading him to great deeds in the field, sacrifices for those he loved,&nbsp; and victories over himself by the gleaming of her golden hair, which&nbsp; shone on him in battle, dreams, and perils by day and night, till after&nbsp; death he finds the lovely spirit waiting to receive and to reward him.&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the stories in the book this was the last one would have supposed&nbsp; Dan would like best, and even Mrs Jo was surprised at his perceiving the&nbsp; moral of the tale through the delicate imagery and romantic language by&nbsp; which it was illustrated. But as she looked and listened she remembered&nbsp; the streak of sentiment and refinement which lay concealed in Dan like&nbsp; the gold vein in a rock, making him quick to feel and to enjoy fine&nbsp; colour in a flower, grace in an animal, sweetness in women, heroism in&nbsp; men, and all the tender ties that bind heart to heart; though he was&nbsp; slow to show it, having no words to express the tastes and instincts&nbsp; which he inherited from his mother. Suffering of soul and body had&nbsp; tamed his stronger passions, and the atmosphere of love and pity now&nbsp; surrounding him purified and warmed his heart till it began to hunger&nbsp; for the food neglected or denied so long. This was plainly written in&nbsp; his too expressive face, as, fancying it unseen, he let it tell the&nbsp; longing after beauty, peace, and happiness embodied for him in the&nbsp; innocent fair girl before him.&nbsp; &nbsp; The conviction of this sad yet natural fact came to Mrs Jo with a pang,&nbsp; for she felt how utterly hopeless such a longing was; since light and&nbsp; darkness were not farther apart than snow-white Bess and sin-stained&nbsp; Dan. No dream of such a thing disturbed the young girl, as her entire&nbsp; unconsciousness plainly showed. But how long would it be before the&nbsp; eloquent eyes betrayed the truth? And then what disappointment for&nbsp; Dan, what dismay for Bess, who was as cool and high and pure as her own&nbsp; marbles, and shunned all thought of love with maidenly reserve.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>How hard everything is made for my poor boy! How can I spoil his little&nbsp; dream, and take away the spirit of good he is beginning to love and long&nbsp; for? When my own dear lads are safely settled I<U+2019>ll never try another,&nbsp; for these things are heart-breaking, and I can<U+2019>t manage any more,<U+2019>&nbsp; thought Mrs Jo, as she put the lining into Teddy<U+2019>s coat-sleeve upside&nbsp; down, so perplexed and grieved was she at this new catastrophe.&nbsp; &nbsp; The story was soon done, and as Bess shook back her hair, Dan asked as&nbsp; eagerly as a boy:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t you like it?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, it<U+2019>s very pretty, and I see the meaning of it; but Undine was&nbsp; always my favourite.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Of course, that<U+2019>s like you--lilies and pearls and souls and pure&nbsp; water. Sintram used to be mine; but I took a fancy to this when I&nbsp; was--ahem--rather down on my luck one time, and it did me good, it was&nbsp; so cheerful and sort of spiritual in its meaning, you know.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Bess opened her blue eyes in wonder at this fancy of Dan<U+2019>s for anything&nbsp; <U+2018>spiritual<U+2019>; but she only nodded, saying: <U+2018>Some of the little songs are&nbsp; sweet and might be set to music.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan laughed; <U+2018>I used to sing the last one to a tune of my own sometimes&nbsp; at sunset:&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018><U+201C>Listening to celestial lays,&nbsp;       Bending thy unclouded gaze&nbsp;       On the pure and living light,&nbsp;       Thou art blest, Aslauga<U+2019>s Knight!<U+201D>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And I was,<U+2019> he added, under his breath, as he glanced towards the&nbsp; sunshine dancing on the wall.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>This one suits you better now<U+2019>; and glad to please him by her interest,&nbsp; Bess read in her soft voice:&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018><U+201C>Healfast, healfast, ye hero wounds;&nbsp;       O knight, be quickly strong!&nbsp;       Beloved strife&nbsp;       For fame and life,&nbsp;       Oh, tarry not too long!<U+201D><U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>m no hero, never can be, and <U+201C>fame and life<U+201D> can<U+2019>t do much for me.&nbsp; Never mind, read me that paper, please. This knock on the head has made&nbsp; a regular fool of me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan<U+2019>s voice was gentle; but the light was gone out of his face now, and&nbsp; he moved restlessly as if the silken pillows were full of thorns. Seeing&nbsp; that his mood had changed, Bess quietly put down the book, took up the&nbsp; paper, and glanced along the columns for something to suit him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You don<U+2019>t care for the money market, I know, nor musical news. Here<U+2019>s&nbsp; a murder; you used to like those; shall I read it? One man kills&nbsp; another--,<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Only a word, but it gave Mrs Jo a thrill, and for a moment she dared not&nbsp; glance at the tell-tale mirror. When she did Dan lay motionless with one&nbsp; hand over his eyes, and Bess was happily reading the art news to ears&nbsp; that never heard a word. Feeling like a thief who has stolen something&nbsp; very precious, Mrs Jo slipped away to her study, and before long Bess&nbsp; followed to report that Dan was fast asleep.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sending her home, with the firm resolve to keep her there as much as&nbsp; possible, Mother Bhaer had an hour of serious thought all alone in the&nbsp; red sunset; and when a sound in the next room led her there, she found&nbsp; that the feigned sleep had become real repose; for Dan lay breathing&nbsp; heavily, with a scarlet spot on either cheek, and one hand clinched on&nbsp; his broad breast. Yearning over him with a deeper pity than ever before,&nbsp; she sat in the little chair beside him, trying to see her way out of&nbsp; this tangle, till his hand slipped down, and in doing so snapped a cord&nbsp; he wore about his neck and let a small case drop to the floor.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo picked it up, and as he did not wake, sat looking at it, idly&nbsp; wondering what charm it held; for the case was of Indian workmanship and&nbsp; the broken cord, of closely woven grass, sweet scented and pale yellow.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I won<U+2019>t pry into any more of the poor fellow<U+2019>s secrets. I<U+2019>ll mend and&nbsp; put it back, and never let him know I<U+2019>ve seen his talisman.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As she spoke she turned the little wallet to examine the fracture, and&nbsp; a card fell into her lap. It was a photograph, cut to fit its covering,&nbsp; and two words were written underneath the face, <U+2018>My Aslauga<U+2019>. For an&nbsp; instant Mrs Jo fancied that it might be one of herself, for all the boys&nbsp; had them; but as the thin paper fell away, she saw the picture Demi took&nbsp; of Bess that happy summer day. There was no doubt now, and with a sigh&nbsp; she put it back, and was about to slip it into Dan<U+2019>s bosom so that not&nbsp; even a stitch should betray her knowledge, when as she leaned towards&nbsp; him, she saw that he was looking straight at her with an expression that&nbsp; surprised her more than any of the strange ones she had ever seen in&nbsp; that changeful face before.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Your hand slipped down; it fell; I was putting it back,<U+2019> explained Mrs&nbsp; Jo, feeling like a naughty child caught in mischief.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You saw the picture?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And know what a fool I am?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, Dan, and am so grieved--<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t worry about me. I<U+2019>m all right--glad you know, though I never&nbsp; meant to tell you. Of course it is only a crazy fancy of mine, and&nbsp; nothing can ever come of it. Never thought there would. Good Lord! what&nbsp; could that little angel ever be to me but what she is--a sort of dream&nbsp; of all that<U+2019>s sweet and good?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; More afflicted by the quiet resignation of his look and tone than by&nbsp; the most passionate ardour, Mrs Jo could only say, with a face full of&nbsp; sympathy:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It is very hard, dear, but there is no other way to look at it. You are&nbsp; wise and brave enough to see that, and to let the secret be ours alone.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I swear I will! not a word nor a look if I can help it. No one guesses,&nbsp; and if it troubles no one, is there any harm in my keeping this, and&nbsp; taking comfort in the pretty fancy that kept me sane in that cursed&nbsp; place?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan<U+2019>s face was eager now, and he hid away the little worn case as if&nbsp; defying any hand to take it from him. Anxious to know everything before&nbsp; giving counsel or comfort, Mrs Jo said quietly:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Keep it, and tell me all about the <U+201C>fancy<U+201D>. Since I have stumbled on&nbsp; your secret, let me know how it came, and how I can help to make it&nbsp; lighter to bear.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You<U+2019>ll laugh; but I don<U+2019>t mind. You always did find out our secrets and&nbsp; give us a lift. Well, I never cared much for books, you know; but down&nbsp; yonder when the devil tormented me I had to do something or go stark&nbsp; mad, so I read both the books you gave me. One was beyond me, till that&nbsp; good old man showed me how to read it; but the other, this one, was a&nbsp; comfort, I tell you. It amused me, and was as pretty as poetry. I liked&nbsp; <U+2018>em all, and most wore out Sintram. See how used up he is! Then I came&nbsp; to this, and it sort of fitted that other happy part of my life, last&nbsp; summer--here.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan stopped a moment as the words lingered on his lips; then, with a&nbsp; long breath, went on, as if it was hard to lay bare the foolish little&nbsp; romance he had woven about a girl, a picture, and a child<U+2019>s story there&nbsp; in the darkness of the place which was as terrible to him as Dante<U+2019>s&nbsp; Inferno, till he found his Beatrice.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I couldn<U+2019>t sleep, and had to think about something, so I used to fancy&nbsp; I was Folko, and see the shining of Aslauga<U+2019>s hair in the sunset on&nbsp; the wall, the gum of the watchman<U+2019>s lamp, and the light that came in at&nbsp; dawn. My cell was high. I could see a bit of sky; sometimes there was&nbsp; a star in it, and that was most as good as a face. I set great store by&nbsp; that patch of blue, and when a white cloud went by, I thought it was the&nbsp; prettiest thing in all this world. I guess I was pretty near a fool; but&nbsp; those thoughts and things helped me through, so they are all solemn true&nbsp; to me, and I can<U+2019>t let them go. The dear shiny head, the white gown, the&nbsp; eyes like stars, and sweet, calm ways that set her as high above me as&nbsp; the moon in heaven. Don<U+2019>t take it away! it<U+2019>s only a fancy, but a man&nbsp; must love something, and I<U+2019>d better love a spirit like her than any of&nbsp; the poor common girls who would care for me.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The quiet despair in Dan<U+2019>s voice pierced Mrs Jo to the heart; but there&nbsp; was no hope and she gave none. Yet she felt that he was right, and that&nbsp; his hapless affection might do more to uplift and purify him than any&nbsp; other he might know. Few women would care to marry Dan now, except such&nbsp; as would hinder, not help, him in the struggle which life would always&nbsp; be to him; and it was better to go solitary to his grave than become&nbsp; what she suspected his father had been--a handsome, unprincipled, and&nbsp; dangerous man, with more than one broken heart to answer for.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, Dan, it is wise to keep this innocent fancy, if it helps and&nbsp; comforts you, till something more real and possible comes to make you&nbsp; happier. I wish I could give you any hope; but we both know that the&nbsp; dear child is the apple of her father<U+2019>s eye, the pride of her mother<U+2019>s&nbsp; heart, and that the most perfect lover they can find will hardly seem to&nbsp; them worthy of their precious daughter. Let her remain for you the high,&nbsp; bright star that leads you up and makes you believe in heaven.<U+2019> Mrs Jo&nbsp; broke down there; it seemed so cruel to destroy the faint hope Dan<U+2019>s&nbsp; eyes betrayed, that she could not moralize when she thought of his hard&nbsp; life and lonely future. Perhaps it was the wisest thing she could have&nbsp; done, for in her hearty sympathy he found comfort for his own loss, and&nbsp; very soon was able to speak again in the manly tone of resignation&nbsp; to the inevitable that showed how honest was his effort to give up&nbsp; everything but the pale shadow of what, for another, might have been a&nbsp; happy possibility.&nbsp; &nbsp; They talked long and earnestly in the twilight; and this second secret&nbsp; bound them closer than the first; for in it there was neither sin nor&nbsp; shame--only the tender pain and patience which has made saints and&nbsp; heroes of far worse men than our poor Dan. When at length they rose at&nbsp; the summons of a bell, all the sunset glory had departed, and in the&nbsp; wintry sky there hung one star, large, soft, and clear, above a snowy&nbsp; world. Pausing at the window before she dropped the curtains, Mrs Jo&nbsp; said cheerfully:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Come and see how beautiful the evening star is, since you love it so.<U+2019>&nbsp; And as he stood behind her, tall and pale, like the ghost of his former&nbsp; self, she added softly: <U+2018>And remember, dear, if the sweet girl is denied&nbsp; you, the old friend is always here--to love and trust and pray for you.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; This time she was not disappointed; and had she asked any reward for&nbsp; many anxieties and cares, she received it when Dan<U+2019>s strong arm came&nbsp; round her, as he said, in a voice which showed her that she had not&nbsp; laboured in vain to pluck her firebrand from the burning:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I never can forget that; for she<U+2019>s helped to save my soul, and make me&nbsp; dare to look up there and say:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+201C>God bless her!<U+201D><U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 22. POSITIVELY LAST APPEARANCE&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Upon my word, I feel as if I lived in a powder-magazine, and don<U+2019>t&nbsp; know which barrel will explode next, and send me flying,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo&nbsp; to herself next day, as she trudged up to Parnassus to suggest to her&nbsp; sister that perhaps the most charming of the young nurses had better&nbsp; return to her marble gods before she unconsciously added another wound&nbsp; to those already won by the human hero. She told no secrets; but a hint&nbsp; was sufficient; for Mrs Amy guarded her daughter as a pearl of great&nbsp; price, and at once devised a very simple means of escape from danger.&nbsp; Mr Laurie was going to Washington on Dan<U+2019>s behalf, and was delighted to&nbsp; take his family with him when the idea was carelessly suggested. So the&nbsp; conspiracy succeeded finely; and Mrs Jo went home, feeling more like a&nbsp; traitor than ever. She expected an explosion; but Dan took the news so&nbsp; quietly, it was plain that he cherished no hope; and Mrs Amy was sure&nbsp; her romantic sister had been mistaken. If she had seen Dan<U+2019>s face when&nbsp; Bess went to say good-bye, her maternal eye would have discovered far&nbsp; more than the unconscious girl did. Mrs Jo trembled lest he should&nbsp; betray himself; but he had learned self-control in a stern school, and&nbsp; would have got through the hard moment bravely, only, when he took both&nbsp; hands, saying heartily:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Good-bye, Princess. If we don<U+2019>t meet again, remember your old friend&nbsp; Dan sometimes,<U+2019> she, touched by his late danger and the wistful look he&nbsp; wore, answered with unusual warmth: <U+2018>How can I help it, when you make us&nbsp; all so proud of you? God bless your mission, and bring you safely home&nbsp; to us again!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As she looked up at him with a face full of frank affection and sweet&nbsp; regret, all that he was losing rose so vividly before him that Dan could&nbsp; not resist the impulse to take the <U+2018>dear goldy head<U+2019> between his hands&nbsp; and kiss it, with a broken <U+2018>Good-bye<U+2019>; then hurried back to his room,&nbsp; feeling as if it were the prison-cell again, with no glimpse of heaven<U+2019>s&nbsp; blue to comfort him.&nbsp; &nbsp; This abrupt caress and departure rather startled Bess; for she felt with&nbsp; a girl<U+2019>s quick instinct that there was something in that kiss unknown&nbsp; before, and looked after him with sudden colour in her cheeks and new&nbsp; trouble in her eyes. Mrs Jo saw it, and fearing a very natural question&nbsp; answered it before it was put.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Forgive him, Bess. He has had a great trouble, and it makes him tender&nbsp; at parting with old friends; for you know he may never come back from&nbsp; the wild world he is going to.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You mean the fall and danger of death?<U+2019> asked Bess, innocently.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, dear; a greater trouble than that. But I cannot tell you any&nbsp; more--except that he has come through it bravely; so you may trust and&nbsp; respect him, as I do.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>He has lost someone he loved. Poor Dan! We must be very kind to him.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; Bess did not ask the question, but seemed content with her solution of&nbsp; the mystery--which was so true that Mrs Jo confirmed it by a nod, and&nbsp; let her go away believing that some tender loss and sorrow wrought the&nbsp; great change all saw in Dan, and made him so slow to speak concerning&nbsp; the past year.&nbsp; &nbsp; But Ted was less easily satisfied, and this unusual reticence goaded&nbsp; him to desperation. His mother had warned him not to trouble Dan with&nbsp; questions till he was quite well; but this prospect of approaching&nbsp; departure made him resolve to have a full, clear, and satisfactory&nbsp; account of the adventures which he felt sure must have been thrilling,&nbsp; from stray words Dan let fall in his fever. So one day when the coast&nbsp; was clear, Master Ted volunteered to amuse the invalid, and did so in&nbsp; the following manner:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Look here, old boy, if you don<U+2019>t want me to read, you<U+2019>ve got to talk,&nbsp; and tell me all about Kansas, and the farms, and that part. The Montana&nbsp; business I know, but you seem to forget what went before. Brace up, and&nbsp; let<U+2019>s have it,<U+2019> he began, with an abruptness which roused Dan from a&nbsp; brown study most effectually.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, I don<U+2019>t forget; it isn<U+2019>t interesting to anyone but myself. I didn<U+2019>t&nbsp; see any farms--gave it up,<U+2019> he said slowly.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Why?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Other things to do.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, brush-making for one thing.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t chaff a fellow. Tell true.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I truly did.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What for?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>To keep out of mischief, as much as anything.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, of all the queer things--and you<U+2019>ve done a lot--that<U+2019>s the&nbsp; queerest,<U+2019> cried Ted, taken aback at this disappointing discovery. But&nbsp; he didn<U+2019>t mean to give up yet, and began again.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What mischief, Dan?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Never you mind. Boys shouldn<U+2019>t bother.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>But I do want to know, awfully, because I<U+2019>m your pal, and care for you&nbsp; no end. Always did. Come, now, tell me a good yarn. I love scrapes. I<U+2019>ll&nbsp; be mum as an oyster if you don<U+2019>t want it known.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Will you?<U+2019> and Dan looked at him, wondering how the boyish face would&nbsp; change if the truth were suddenly told him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ll swear it on locked fists, if you like. I know it was jolly, and&nbsp; I<U+2019>m aching to hear.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You are as curious as a girl. More than some--Josie and--and Bess never&nbsp; asked a question.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>They don<U+2019>t care about rows and things; they liked the mine business,&nbsp; heroes, and that sort. So do I, and I<U+2019>m as proud as Punch over it; but&nbsp; I see by your eyes that there was something else before that, and I<U+2019>m&nbsp; bound to find out who Blair and Mason are, and who was hit and who ran&nbsp; away, and all the rest of it.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What!<U+2019> cried Dan, in a tone that made Ted jump.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, you used to mutter about <U+2018>em in your sleep, and Uncle Laurie&nbsp; wondered. So did I; but don<U+2019>t mind, if you can<U+2019>t remember, or would&nbsp; rather not.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>What else did I say? Queer, what stuff a man will talk when his wits&nbsp; are gone.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>That<U+2019>s all I heard; but it seemed interesting, and I just mentioned it,&nbsp; thinking it might refresh your memory a bit,<U+2019> said Teddy, very politely;&nbsp; for Dan<U+2019>s frown was heavy at that moment.&nbsp; &nbsp; It cleared off at this reply, and after a look at the boy squirming with&nbsp; suppressed impatience in his chair, Dan made up his mind to amuse him&nbsp; with a game of cross-purposes and half-truths, hoping to quench his&nbsp; curiosity, and so get peace.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Let me see; Blair was a lad I met in the cars, and Mason a poor fellow&nbsp; who was in a--well, a sort of hospital where I happened to be. Blair ran&nbsp; off to his brothers, and I suppose I might say Mason was hit, because he&nbsp; died there. Does that suit you?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>No, it doesn<U+2019>t. Why did Blair run? and who hit the other fellow? I<U+2019>m&nbsp; sure there was a fight somewhere, wasn<U+2019>t there?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes!&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I guess I know what it was about.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>The devil, you do! Let<U+2019>s hear you guess. Must be amusing,<U+2019> said Dan,&nbsp; affecting an ease he did not feel.&nbsp; &nbsp; Charmed to be allowed to free his mind, Ted at once unfolded the boyish&nbsp; solution of the mystery which he had been cherishing, for he felt that&nbsp; there was one somewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>You needn<U+2019>t say yes, if I guess right and you are under oath to keep&nbsp; silent. I shall know by your face, and never tell. Now see if I<U+2019>m not&nbsp; right. Out there they have wild doings, and it<U+2019>s my belief you were in&nbsp; some of <U+2018>em. I don<U+2019>t mean robbing mails, and KluKluxing, and that sort&nbsp; of thing; but defending the settlers, or hanging some scamp, or even&nbsp; shooting a few, as a fellow must sometimes, in self-defence. Ah, ha!&nbsp; I<U+2019>ve hit it, I see. Needn<U+2019>t speak; I know the flash of your old eye, and&nbsp; the clench of your big fist.<U+2019> And Ted pranced with satisfaction.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Drive on, smart boy, and don<U+2019>t lose the trail,<U+2019> said Dan, finding a&nbsp; curious sense of comfort in some of these random words, and longing, but&nbsp; not daring, to confirm the true ones. He might have confessed the crime,&nbsp; but not the punishment that followed, the sense of its disgrace was&nbsp; still so strong upon him.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I knew I should get it; can<U+2019>t deceive me long,<U+2019> began Ted, with such an&nbsp; air of pride Dan could not help a short laugh.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>It<U+2019>s a relief, isn<U+2019>t it, to have it off your mind? Now, just confide in&nbsp; me and it<U+2019>s all safe, unless you<U+2019>ve sworn not to tell.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I have.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Oh, well, then don<U+2019>t<U+2019>; and Ted<U+2019>s face fell, but he was himself again&nbsp; in a moment and said, with the air of a man of the world: <U+2018>It<U+2019>s all&nbsp; right--I understand--honour binds--silence to death, etc. Glad you stood&nbsp; by your mate in the hospital. How many did you kill?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Only one.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Bad lot, of course?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A damned rascal.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Well, don<U+2019>t look so fierce; I<U+2019>ve no objection. Wouldn<U+2019>t mind popping&nbsp; at some of those bloodthirsty blackguards myself. Had to dodge and keep&nbsp; quiet after it, I suppose.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Pretty quiet for a long spell.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Got off all right in the end, and headed for your mines and did that&nbsp; jolly brave thing. Now, I call that decidedly interesting and capital.&nbsp; I<U+2019>m glad to know it; but I won<U+2019>t blab.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Mind you don<U+2019>t. Look here. Ted, if you<U+2019>d killed a man, would it trouble&nbsp; you--a bad one, I mean?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; The lad opened his mouth to say, <U+2018>Not a bit,<U+2019> but checked that answer as&nbsp; if something in Dan<U+2019>s face made him change his mind. <U+2018>Well, if it was my&nbsp; duty in war or self-defence, I suppose I shouldn<U+2019>t; but if I<U+2019>d pitched&nbsp; into him in a rage, I guess I should be very sorry. Shouldn<U+2019>t wonder if&nbsp; he sort of haunted me, and remorse gnawed me as it did Aram and those&nbsp; fellows. You don<U+2019>t mind, do you? It was a fair fight, wasn<U+2019>t it?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Yes, I was in the right; but I wish I<U+2019>d been out of it. Women don<U+2019>t see&nbsp; it that way, and look horrified at such things. Makes it hard; but it&nbsp; don<U+2019>t matter.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t tell <U+2018>em; then they can<U+2019>t worry,<U+2019> said Ted, with the nod of one&nbsp; versed in the management of the sex.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Don<U+2019>t intend to. Mind you keep your notions to yourself, for some of&nbsp; <U+2018>em are wide of the mark. Now you may read if you like<U+2019>; and there the&nbsp; talk ended; but Ted took great comfort in it, and looked as wise as an&nbsp; owl afterwards.&nbsp; &nbsp; A few quiet weeks followed, during which Dan chafed at the delay; and&nbsp; when at length word came that his credentials were ready, he was eager&nbsp; to be off, to forget a vain love in hard work, and live for others,&nbsp; since he might not for himself.&nbsp; &nbsp; So one wild March morning our Sintram rode away, with horse and hound,&nbsp; to face again the enemies who would have conquered him, but for Heaven<U+2019>s&nbsp; help and human pity.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ah, me! it does seem as if life was made of partings, and they get&nbsp; harder as we go on,<U+2019> sighed Mrs Jo, a week later, as she sat in the long&nbsp; parlour at Parnassus one evening, whither the family had gone to welcome&nbsp; the travellers back.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>And meetings too, dear; for here we are, and Nat is on his way at last.&nbsp; Look for the silver lining, as Marmee used to say, and be comforted,<U+2019>&nbsp; answered Mrs Amy, glad to be at home and find no wolves prowling near&nbsp; her sheepfold.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve been so worried lately, I can<U+2019>t help croaking. I wonder what Dan&nbsp; thought at not seeing you again? It was wise; but he would have enjoyed&nbsp; another look at home faces before he went into the wilderness,<U+2019> said Mrs&nbsp; Jo regretfully.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Much better so. We left notes and all we could think of that he might&nbsp; need, and slipped away before he came. Bess really seemed relieved;&nbsp; I<U+2019>m sure I was<U+2019>; and Mrs Amy smoothed an anxious line out of her white&nbsp; forehead, as she smiled at her daughter, laughing happily among her&nbsp; cousins.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mrs Jo shook her head as if the silver lining of that cloud was hard to&nbsp; find; but she had no time to croak again, for just then Mr Laurie came&nbsp; in looking well pleased at something.&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>A new picture has arrived; face towards the music-room, good people,&nbsp; and tell me how you like it. I call it <U+201C>Only a fiddler<U+201D>, after&nbsp; Andersen<U+2019>s story. What name will you give it?<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; As he spoke he threw open the wide doors, and just beyond they saw a&nbsp; young man standing, with a beaming face, and a violin in his hand. There&nbsp; was no doubt about the name to this picture, and with the cry <U+2018>Nat!&nbsp; Nat!<U+2019> there was a general uprising. But Daisy reached him first, and&nbsp; seemed to have lost her usual composure somewhere on the way, for she&nbsp; clung to him, sobbing with the shock of a surprise and joy too great for&nbsp; her to bear quietly. Everything was settled by that tearful and tender&nbsp; embrace, for, though Mrs Meg speedily detached her daughter, it was only&nbsp; to take her place; while Demi shook Nat<U+2019>s hand with brotherly warmth,&nbsp; and Josie danced round them like Macbeth<U+2019>s three witches in one,&nbsp; chanting in her most tragic tones:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Chirper thou wast; second violin thou art; first thou shalt be. Hail,&nbsp; all hail!<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; This caused a laugh, and made things gay and comfortable at once. Then&nbsp; the usual fire of questions and answers began, to be kept up briskly&nbsp; while the boys admired Nat<U+2019>s blond beard and foreign clothes, the girls&nbsp; his improved appearance--for he was ruddy with good English beef&nbsp; and beer, and fresh with the sea-breezes which had blown him swiftly&nbsp; home--and the older folk rejoiced over his prospects. Of course all&nbsp; wanted to hear him play; and when tongues tired, he gladly did his best&nbsp; for them, surprising the most critical by his progress in music even&nbsp; more than by the energy and self-possession which made a new man&nbsp; of bashful Nat. By and by when the violin--that most human of all&nbsp; instruments--had sung to them the loveliest songs without words, he&nbsp; said, looking about him at these old friends with what Mr Bhaer called a&nbsp; <U+2018>feeling-full<U+2019> expression of happiness and content:&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now let me play something that you will all remember though you won<U+2019>t&nbsp; love it as I do<U+2019>; and standing in the attitude which Ole Bull has&nbsp; immortalized, he played the street melody he gave them the first night&nbsp; he came to Plumfield. They remembered it, and joined in the plaintive&nbsp; chorus, which fitly expressed his own emotions:&nbsp; &nbsp;     <U+2018>Oh my heart is sad and weary&nbsp;      Everywhere I roam,&nbsp;      Longing for the old plantation&nbsp;      And for the old folks at home.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Now I feel better,<U+2019> said Mrs Jo, as they all trooped down the hill soon&nbsp; after. <U+2018>Some of our boys are failures, but I think this one is going to&nbsp; be a success, and patient Daisy a happy girl at last. Nat is your work,&nbsp; Fritz, and I congratulate you heartily.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>Ach, we can but sow the seed and trust that it falls on good ground.&nbsp; I planted, perhaps, but you watched that the fowls of the air did not&nbsp; devour it, and brother Laurie watered generously; so we will share the&nbsp; harvest among us, and be glad even for a small one, heart<U+2019>s-dearest.<U+2019>&nbsp; &nbsp; <U+2018>I thought the seed had fallen on very stony ground with my poor Dan;&nbsp; but I shall not be surprised if he surpasses all the rest in the real&nbsp; success of life, since there is more rejoicing over one repentant sinner&nbsp; than many saints,<U+2019> answered Mrs Jo, still clinging fast to her black&nbsp; sheep although a whole flock of white ones trotted happily before her.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a strong temptation to the weary historian to close the present&nbsp; tale with an earthquake which should engulf Plumfield and its environs&nbsp; so deeply in the bowels of the earth that no youthful Schliemann could&nbsp; ever find a vestige of it. But as that somewhat melodramatic conclusion&nbsp; might shock my gentle readers, I will refrain, and forestall the usual&nbsp; question, <U+2018>How did they end?<U+2019> by briefly stating that all the marriages&nbsp; turned out well. The boys prospered in their various callings; so did&nbsp; the girls, for Bess and Josie won honours in their artistic careers, and&nbsp; in the course of time found worthy mates. Nan remained a busy, cheerful,&nbsp; independent spinster, and dedicated her life to her suffering sisters&nbsp; and their children, in which true woman<U+2019>s work she found abiding&nbsp; happiness. Dan never married, but lived, bravely and usefully, among his&nbsp; chosen people till he was shot defending them, and at last lay quietly&nbsp; asleep in the green wilderness he loved so well, with a lock of golden&nbsp; hair upon his breast, and a smile on his face which seemed to say that&nbsp; Aslauga<U+2019>s Knight had fought his last fight and was at peace. Stuffy&nbsp; became an alderman, and died suddenly of apoplexy after a public dinner.&nbsp; Dolly was a society man of mark till he lost his money, when he found&nbsp; congenial employment in a fashionable tailoring establishment. Demi&nbsp; became a partner, and lived to see his name above the door, and Rob was&nbsp; a professor at Laurence College; but Teddy eclipsed them all by becoming&nbsp; an eloquent and famous clergyman, to the great delight of his astonished&nbsp; mother. And now, having endeavoured to suit everyone by many weddings,&nbsp; few deaths, and as much prosperity as the eternal fitness of things will&nbsp; permit, let the music stop, the lights die out, and the curtain fall for&nbsp; ever on the March family.</p>
