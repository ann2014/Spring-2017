The valley train always waits for the</Content><Content>express."</Content><Content>"It's coming in now!"</Content><Content>"Oh, good, so it is!"</Content><Content>"Late by twenty minutes exactly!"</Content><Content>"Stand back there!" yelled a porter, setting down a box with a slam, and</Content><Content>motioning the excited, fluttering group of girls to a position of</Content><Content>greater safety than the extreme edge of the platform. "Llangarmon</Content><Content>Junction! Change for Glanafon and Graigwen!"</Content><Content>Snorting and puffing, as if in agitated apology for the tardiness of its</Content><Content>arrival, the train came steaming into the station, the drag of its</Content><Content>brakes adding yet another item of noise to the prevailing babel.</Content><Content>Intending passengers clutched bags and baskets; fathers of families gave</Content><Content>a last eye to the luggage; mothers grasped children firmly by the hand;</Content><Content>a distracted youth, seeking vainly for his portmanteau, upset a stack of</Content><Content>bicycles with a crash; while above all the din and turmoil rose the</Content><Content>strident, rasping voice of a book-stall boy, crying his selection of</Content><Content>papers with ear-splitting zeal.</Content><Content>From the windows of the in-coming express waved seventeen agitated</Content><Content>pocket-handkerchiefs, and the signal was answered by a counter-display</Content><Content>of cambric from the twenty girls hustled back by an inspector in the</Content><Content>direction of the weighing-machine.</Content><Content>"There's Helen!"</Content><Content>"And Ruth, surely!"</Content><Content>"Oh! where's Marjorie?"</Content><Content>"There! Can't you see her, with Doris?"</Content><Content>"That's Mamie, waving to me!"</Content><Content>"What's become of Kathleen?"</Content><Content>One moment more, and the neat school hats of the new-comers had swelled</Content><Content>the group of similar school hats already collected on the platform;</Content><Content>ecstatic greetings were exchanged, urgent questions asked and hasty</Content><Content>answers given, and items of choice information poured forth with the</Content><Content>utmost volubility of which the English tongue is capable. Urged by brief</Content><Content>directions from a mistress in charge, the chattering crew surged towards</Content><Content>a siding, and made for a particular corridor carriage marked "Reserved".</Content><Content>Here handbags, umbrellas, wraps, and lunch-baskets were hastily stowed</Content><Content>away in the racks, and, Miss Moseley having assured herself that not a</Content><Content>single lamb of her flock was left behind, the grinning porter slammed</Content><Content>the doors, the green flag waved, and the local train, long overdue,</Content><Content>started with a jerk for the Craigwen Valley.</Content><Content>Past the grey old castle that looked seawards over the estuary, past the</Content><Content>little white town of Llangarmon, with its ancient walls and fortified</Content><Content>gates, past the quay where the fishing smacks were lying idly at anchor</Content><Content>and a pleasure-steamer was unloading its human cargo, past the long</Content><Content>stretch of sandy common, where the white tents of the Territorials</Content><Content>evoked an outcry of interest, then up alongside the broad tidal river</Content><Content>towards where the mountains, faint and misty, rose shouldering one</Content><Content>another till they merged into the white nebulous region of the</Content><Content>cloud-flecked sky. Those lucky ones who had secured window seats on the</Content><Content>river side of the carriage were loud in their acclamations of</Content><Content>satisfaction as familiar objects in the landscape came into sight.</Content><Content>"There's Cwm Dinas. I wish they could float a big Union Jack on the</Content><Content>summit."</Content><Content>"It would be a landmark all right."</Content><Content>"Oh, the flag's up at Plas Cafn!"</Content><Content>"We'll have one at school this term?"</Content><Content>"Oh, I say! Move a scrap," pleaded Ulyth Stanton plaintively. "We only</Content><Content>get fields and woods on our side. I can't see anything at all for your</Content><Content>heads. You might move. What selfish pigs you are! Well, I don't care;</Content><Content>I'm going to talk."</Content><Content>"You have been talking already. You've never stopped, in fact," remarked</Content><Content>Beth Broadway, proffering a swiftly disappearing packet of pear drops</Content><Content>with a generosity born of the knowledge that all sweets would be</Content><Content>confiscated on arrival at The Woodlands.</Content><Content>"I know I have, but that was merely by the way. It wasn't anything very</Content><Content>particular, and I've got something I want to tell you--something</Content><Content>fearfully important. Absolutely super! D'you know, she's actually coming</Content><Content>to school. Isn't it great? She's to be my room-mate. I'm just wild to</Content><Content>see her. I hope her ship won't be stopped by storms."</Content><Content>"By the Muses, whom are you talking about?"</Content><Content>"'She' means the cat," sniggered Gertrude Oliver.</Content><Content>"Why! can't you guess? What stupids you are! It's Rona, of course--Rona</Content><Content>Mitchell from New Zealand."</Content><Content>"You're ragging!"</Content><Content>"It's a fact. It is indeed!"</Content><Content>The incredulity on the countenances of her companions having yielded to</Content><Content>an expression of interest, Ulyth continued her information with</Content><Content>increased zest, and a conscious though would-be nonchalant air of</Content><Content>importance.</Content><Content>"Her father wants her to go to school in England, so he decided to send</Content><Content>her to The Woodlands, so that she might be with me!"</Content><Content>"Do you mean that girl you were so very proud of corresponding with? I</Content><Content>forget how the whole business began," broke in Stephanie Radford.</Content><Content>"Don't you remember? It was through a magazine we take. The editor</Content><Content>arranged for readers of the magazine in England to exchange letters with</Content><Content>other readers overseas. He gave me Rona. We've been writing to each</Content><Content>other every month for two years."</Content><Content>"I had an Australian, but she wouldn't write regularly, so we dropped</Content><Content>it," volunteered Beth Broadway. "I believe Gertrude had somebody too."</Content><Content>"Yes, a girl in Canada. I never got farther than one short letter and a</Content><Content>picture post card, though. I do so loathe writing," sighed Gertrude.</Content><Content>"Ulyth's the only one who's kept the thing up."</Content><Content>"And do you mean to say this New Zealander's actually coming to our</Content><Content>school?" asked Stephanie.</Content><Content>"That's the joysome gist of my remarks! I can't tell you how I'm pining</Content><Content>and yearning to see her. She seems like a girl out of a story. To think</Content><Content>of it! Rona Mitchell at school with us!"</Content><Content>"Suppose you don't like her?"</Content><Content>"Oh, I'm certain I shall! She's written me the jolliest, loveliest,</Content><Content>funniest letters! I feel I know her already. We shall be the very best</Content><Content>of friends. Her father has a huge farm of I can't tell you how many</Content><Content>miles, and she has two horses of her own, and fords rivers when she's</Content><Content>out riding."</Content><Content>"When's she to arrive?"</Content><Content>"Probably to-morrow. She's travelling by the _King George_, and coming</Content><Content>up straight from London to school directly she lands. I hope she's got</Content><Content>to England safely. She must have left home ever such a long time ago.</Content><Content>How fearfully exciting for her to----"</Content><Content>But here Ulyth's reflections were brought to an abrupt close, for the</Content><Content>train was approaching Glanafon Ferry, and her comrades, busily</Content><Content>collecting their various handbags, would lend no further ear to her</Content><Content>remarks.</Content><Content>The little wayside station, erstwhile the quietest and sleepiest on the</Content><Content>line, was soon overflowing with girls and their belongings. Miss Moseley</Content><Content>flitted up and down the platform, marshalling her charges like a</Content><Content>faithful collie, the one porter did his slow best, and after a few</Content><Content>agitated returns to the compartments for forgotten articles, everything</Content><Content>was successfully collected, and the train went steaming away down the</Content><Content>valley in the direction of Craigwen. It seemed to take the last link of</Content><Content>civilization with it, and to leave only the pure, unsullied country</Content><Content>behind. The girls crossed the line and walked through the white station</Content><Content>gate with pleased anticipation writ large on their faces. It was the</Content><Content>cult at The Woodlands to idolize nature and the picturesque, and they</Content><Content>had reached a part of their journey which was a particular source of</Content><Content>pride to the school.</Content><Content>Any admirer of scenery would have been struck with the lovely and</Content><Content>romantic view which burst upon the eye as the travellers left the</Content><Content>platform at Glanafon and walked down the short, grassy road that led to</Content><Content>the ferry. To the south stretched the wide pool of the river, blue as</Content><Content>the heaven above where it caught the reflection of the September sky,</Content><Content>but dark and mysterious where it mirrored the thick woods that shaded</Content><Content>its banks. Near at hand towered the tall, heather-crowned crag of Cwm</Content><Content>Dinas, while the rugged peaks of Penllwyd and Penglaslyn frowned in</Content><Content>majesty of clouds beyond. The ferry itself was one of those delightful</Content><Content>survivals of mediævalism which linger here and there in a few fortunate</Content><Content>corners of our isles. A large flat-bottomed boat was slung on chains</Content><Content>which spanned the river, and could be worked slowly across the water by</Content><Content>means of a small windlass. Though it was perfectly possible, and often</Content><Content>even more convenient, to drive to the school direct from Llangarmon</Content><Content>Junction, so great was the popular feeling in favour of arrival by the</Content><Content>ferry that at the autumn and spring reunions the girls were allowed to</Content><Content>avail themselves of the branch railway and approach The Woodlands by way</Content><Content>of the river.</Content><Content>They now hurried on to the boat as if anticipating a pleasure-jaunt. The</Content><Content>capacities of the flat were designed to accommodate a flock of sheep or</Content><Content>a farm wagon and horses, so there was room and to spare even for</Content><Content>thirty-seven girls and their hand luggage. Evan Davis, the crusty old</Content><Content>ferryman, greeted them with his usual inarticulate grunt, a kind of "Oh,</Content><Content>here you are again, are you!" form of welcome which was more forceful</Content><Content>than gracious. He linked the protecting chains carefully across the end</Content><Content>of the boat, called out a remark in Welsh to his son, Griffith, and,</Content><Content>seizing the handle, began to work the windlass. Very slowly and</Content><Content>leisurely the flat swung out into the river. The tide was at the full</Content><Content>and the wide expanse of water seemed like a lake. The clanking chains</Content><Content>brought up bunches of seaweed and river grass which fell with an oozy</Content><Content>thud upon the deck. The mountain air, blowing straight from Penllwyd,</Content><Content>was tinged with ozone from the tide. The girls stood looking up the</Content><Content>reach of water towards the hills, and tasting the salt on their lips</Content><Content>with supreme gratification. It was not every school that assembled by</Content><Content>such a romantic means of conveyance as an ancient flat-bottomed</Content><Content>ferry-boat, and they rejoiced over their privileges.</Content><Content>"I'm glad the tide's full; it makes the crossing so much wider,"</Content><Content>murmured Helen Cooper, with an eye of admiration on the woods.</Content><Content>"Don't suppose Evan shares your enthusiasm," laughed Marjorie Earnshaw.</Content><Content>"He's paid the same, whatever the length of the journey."</Content><Content>"Old Grumps gets half a crown for his job, so he needn't grumble," put</Content><Content>in Doris Deane.</Content><Content>"Oh, trust him! He'd look sour at a pound note."</Content><Content>"What makes him so cross?"</Content><Content>"Oh, he's old and lame, I suppose, and has a crotchety temper."</Content><Content>"Here we are at last!"</Content><Content>The boat was grating on the shore. Griffith was unfastening the movable</Content><Content>end, and in another moment the girls were springing out gingerly, one by</Content><Content>one, on to the decidedly muddy stepping-stones that formed a rough</Content><Content>causeway to the bank. A cart was waiting to convey the handbags (all</Content><Content>boxes had been sent as "advance luggage" two days before), so,</Content><Content>disencumbered of their numerous possessions, the girls started to walk</Content><Content>the steep uphill mile that led to The Woodlands.</Content><Content>Miss Bowes and Miss Teddington, the partners who owned the school, had</Content><Content>been exceptionally fortunate in their choice of a house. If, as runs the</Content><Content>modern theory, beautiful surroundings in our early youth are of the</Content><Content>utmost importance in training our perceptions and aiding the growth of</Content><Content>our higher selves, then surely nowhere in the British Isles could a more</Content><Content>suitable setting have been found for a home of education. The long</Content><Content>terrace commanded a view of the whole of the Craigwen Valley, an expanse</Content><Content>of about sixteen miles. The river, like a silver ribbon, wound through</Content><Content>woods and marshland till it widened into a broad tidal estuary as it</Content><Content>neared the sea. The mountains, which rose tier after tier from the level</Content><Content>green meadows, had their lower slopes thickly clothed with pines and</Content><Content>larches; but where they towered above the level of a thousand feet the</Content><Content>forest growth gave way to gorse and bracken, and their jagged summits,</Content><Content>bare of all vegetation save a few clumps of coarse grass, showed a</Content><Content>splintered, weather-worn outline against the sky. Penllwyd, Penglaslyn,</Content><Content>and Glyder Garmon, those lofty peaks like three strong Welsh giants,</Content><Content>seemed to guard the entrance to the enchanted valley, and to keep it a</Content><Content>place apart, a last fortress of nature, a sanctuary for birds and</Content><Content>flowers, a paradise of green shade and leaping waters, and a</Content><Content>breathing-space for body and soul.</Content><Content>The house, named "The Woodlands" by Miss Bowes in place of its older but</Content><Content>rather unpronounceable name of Llwyngwrydd (the green grove), took both</Content><Content>its Welsh and English appellations from a beautiful glade, planted with</Content><Content>oaks, which formed the southern boundary of the property. Through this</Content><Content>park-like dell flowed a mountain stream, tumbling in little white</Content><Content>cascades between the big boulders that formed its bed, and pouring in</Content><Content>quite a waterfall over a ledge of rock into a wide pool. Its steady</Content><Content>rippling murmur never stopped, and could be heard day and night through</Content><Content>the ever-open windows, gentle and subdued in dry weather, but rising to</Content><Content>a roar when rain in the hills brought the flood down in a turbulent</Content><Content>torrent.</Content><Content>Through lessons, play, or dreams this sound of many waters was ever</Content><Content>present; it gave an atmosphere to the school which, if passed unnoticed</Content><Content>through extreme familiarity, would have been instantly missed if it</Content><Content>could have stopped. To the girls this stream was a kind of guardian</Content><Content>deity, with the glade for its sacred grove. They loved every rock and</Content><Content>stone and cataract, almost every patch of brown moss upon its boulders.</Content><Content>Each morning of the summer term they bathed before breakfast in the pool</Content><Content>where a big oak-tree shaded the cataract. It was so close to the house</Content><Content>that they could run out in mackintoshes, and so retired that it</Content><Content>resembled a private swimming-bath. Here they enjoyed themselves like</Content><Content>water-nymphs, splashing in the shallows, plunging in the pool, swinging</Content><Content>from the boughs of the oak-tree, and scrambling over the lichened</Content><Content>boulders. It was a source of deep regret to the hardier spirits that</Content><Content>they were not allowed to take their morning dip in the stream all the</Content><Content>year round; but on that score mistresses were adamant, and with the</Content><Content>close of September the naiads perforce withdrew from their favourite</Content><Content>element till it was warmed again by the May sunshine.</Content><Content>The house itself had originally been an ancient Welsh dwelling of the</Content><Content>days of the Tudors, but had been largely added to in later times. The</Content><Content>straight front, with its rows of windows, classic doorway, and</Content><Content>stone-balustraded terrace, was certainly Georgian in type, and the</Content><Content>tower, an architectural eyesore, was plainly Victorian. The taste of the</Content><Content>early nineteenth century had not been faultless, and all the best part</Content><Content>of the building, from an artistic point of view, lay at the back. This</Content><Content>mainly consisted of kitchens and servants' quarters, but there still</Content><Content>remained a large hall, which was the chief glory of the establishment.</Content><Content>It was very lofty, for in common with other specimens of the period it</Content><Content>had no upper story, the roof being timbered like that of a church. The</Content><Content>walls were panelled with oak to a height of about eight feet, and above</Content><Content>that were decorated with elaborate designs in plaster relief,</Content><Content>representing lions, wild boars, stags, unicorns, and other heraldic</Content><Content>devices from the coat-of-arms of the original owner of the estate. A</Content><Content>narrow winding staircase led to a minstrels' gallery, from which was</Content><Content>suspended a wooden shield emblazoned with the Welsh dragon and the</Content><Content>national motto, "Cymru am byth" ("Wales for ever").</Content><Content>If the hall was the main picturesque asset of the building, it must be</Content><Content>admitted that the unromantic front portion was highly convenient, and</Content><Content>had been most readily adaptable for a school. The large light rooms of</Content><Content>the ground floor made excellent classrooms, and the upper story was so</Content><Content>lavishly provided with windows that it had been possible, by means of</Content><Content>wooden partitions, to turn the great bedrooms into rows of small</Content><Content>dormitories, each capable of accommodating two girls.</Content><Content>The bright airy house, the terrace with its glorious view of the valley,</Content><Content>the large old-fashioned garden, and, above all, the stream and the glade</Content><Content>made a very pleasant setting for the school life of the forty-eight</Content><Content>pupils at The Woodlands. The two principals worked together in perfect</Content><Content>harmony. Each had her own department. Miss Bowes, who was short, stout,</Content><Content>grey-haired, and motherly, looked after the housekeeping, the hygiene,</Content><Content>and the business side. She wrote letters to parents, kept the accounts,</Content><Content>interviewed tradespeople, superintended the mending, and was the final</Content><Content>referee in all matters pertaining to health and general conduct. "Dear</Content><Content>Old Rainbow", as the girls nicknamed her, was frankly popular, for she</Content><Content>was sympathetic and usually disposed to listen, in reason, to the</Content><Content>various plaints which were brought to the sanctum of her private</Content><Content>sitting-room. Her authority alone could excuse preparation, order</Content><Content>breakfast in bed, remit practising, dispense jujubes, allow special</Content><Content>festivities, and grant half-holidays. It was rumoured that she thought</Content><Content>of retiring and leaving the school to her partner, and such a report</Content><Content>always drew from parents the opinion that she would be greatly missed.</Content><Content>Miss Teddington, younger by many years, took a more active part in the</Content><Content>teaching, and superintended the games and outdoor sports. She was tall</Content><Content>and athletic, a good mathematician, and interested in archæology and</Content><Content>nature study. She led the walks and rambles, taught the Sixth Form, and</Content><Content>represented the more scholastic and modern element. Her enterprise</Content><Content>initiated all fresh undertakings, and her enthusiasm carried them</Content><Content>forward with success. "Hard-as-nails" the girls sometimes called her,</Content><Content>for she coddled nobody and expected the utmost from each one's capacity.</Content><Content>If she was rather uncompromising, however, she was just, and a strong</Content><Content>vein of humour toned down much of the severity of her remarks. To be</Content><Content>chided by a person whose eye is capable of twinkling takes part of the</Content><Content>sting from the reprimand, and the general verdict of the school was to</Content><Content>the effect that "Teddie was a keen old watch-dog, but her bark was worse</Content><Content>than her bite."</Content><Content>Of the other mistresses and girls we will say more anon. Having</Content><Content>introduced my readers to The Woodlands, it is time for the story to</Content><Content>begin.</Content><Content>CHAPTER II</Content><Content>A Friend from the Bush</Content><Content>Ulyth Stanton was a decided personality in the Lower Fifth. If not</Content><Content>exactly pretty, she was a dainty little damsel, and knew how to make the</Content><Content>best of herself. Her fair hair was glossy and waved in the most becoming</Content><Content>fashion, her clothes were well cut, her gloves and shoes immaculate. She</Content><Content>had an artistic temperament, and loved to be surrounded by pretty</Content><Content>things. She was rather a favourite at The Woodlands, for she had few</Content><Content>sharp angles and possessed a fair share of tact. If the girls laughed</Content><Content>sometimes at what they called her "high-falutin' notions" they</Content><Content>nevertheless respected her opinions and admired her more than they</Content><Content>always chose to admit. It was an accepted fact that Ulyth stuck to her</Content><Content>word and generally carried through anything that she once undertook. She</Content><Content>alone of six members of her form who had begun to correspond with girls</Content><Content>abroad, at the instigation of the magazine editor, had written</Content><Content>regularly, and had cultivated the overseas friendship with enthusiasm.</Content><Content>The element of romance about the affair had appealed to Ulyth. It was so</Content><Content>strange to receive letters from someone you had never seen. To be sure,</Content><Content>Rona had only given a somewhat bald account of her home and her doings,</Content><Content>but even this outline was so different from English life that Ulyth's</Content><Content>imagination filled the gaps, and pictured her unknown correspondent</Content><Content>among scenes of unrivalled interest and excitement. Ulyth had once seen</Content><Content>a most wonderful film entitled "Rose of the Wilderness", and though the</Content><Content>scenes depicted were supposed to be in the region of the Wild West, she</Content><Content>decided that they would equally well represent the backwoods of New</Content><Content>Zealand, and that the beautiful, dashing, daring heroine, so aptly</Content><Content>called "the Prairie Flower", was probably a speaking likeness of Rona</Content><Content>Mitchell. When she learnt that owing to her letters Rona's father had</Content><Content>determined to send his daughter to school at The Woodlands, her</Content><Content>excitement was immense. She had at once petitioned Miss Bowes to have</Content><Content>her as a room-mate, and was now awaiting her advent with the very</Content><Content>keenest anticipation.</Content><Content>There was a little uncertainty about the time of the new girl's arrival,</Content><Content>for it depended upon the punctuality of the ocean liner, a doubtful</Content><Content>matter if there were a storm; and the feeling that she might be expected</Content><Content>any hour between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. made havoc of Ulyth's day. It was</Content><Content>impossible to attend to lessons when she was listening for the sound of</Content><Content>a taxi on the drive, and even the attractions of tennis could not decoy</Content><Content>her out of sight of the front door.</Content><Content>"I must be the very first to welcome her," she persisted. "Of course</Content><Content>it's not the same to all the rest of you--I understand that. She's to be</Content><Content>my special property, my Prairie Rose!"</Content><Content>"All serene! If you care to waste your time lounging about the steps you</Content><Content>can. We're not in such a frantic state to see your paragon," laughed the</Content><Content>girls as they ran down the garden to the courts. After all, the waiting</Content><Content>was in vain. Tea-time came without a sign of the new-comer. It was</Content><Content>unlikely that she would turn up now until the evening train, and Ulyth</Content><Content>resigned herself to the inevitable. But when the school was almost</Content><Content>half-way through its bread and butter and gooseberry jam, a sudden</Content><Content>commotion occurred in the hall. There was a noise such as nobody ever</Content><Content>remembered to have heard at The Woodlands before.</Content><Content>"Thank goodness gracious I've got meself here at last!" cried a loud</Content><Content>nasal voice. "Where'll I stick these things? Oh yes, there's heaps more</Content><Content>inside that automobile! Travelling's no joke, I can tell you; I'm tired</Content><Content>to death. Any tea about? I could drink the sea. My gracious, I've had a</Content><Content>time of it coming here!"</Content><Content>At the first word Miss Bowes had glided from the room, and the voice</Content><Content>died away as the door of her private study closed. Sounds suggestive of</Content><Content>the carrying upstairs of luggage followed, and a hinnying laugh echoed</Content><Content>once down the stairs. The girls looked at one another; there was a</Content><Content>shadow in Ulyth's eyes. She did not share in the general smile that</Content><Content>passed round the table, and she finished her tea in dead silence.</Content><Content>"Going to sample your new property?" whispered Mary Acton as the girls</Content><Content>pushed back their chairs.</Content><Content>"What's the formula for swearing an undying friendship?" giggled Addie</Content><Content>Knighton.</Content><Content>"Was it Rose of Sharon you called her?" twinkled Christine Crosswood.</Content><Content>"Or Lily of the Valley?"</Content><Content>Ulyth did not reply. She walked upstairs very slowly. The nasal twang of</Content><Content>that high-pitched voice in the hall had wiped the bloom off her</Content><Content>anticipation. The small double dormitory in which she slept was No. 3,</Content><Content>Room 5. The door was half-open, so she entered without knocking. Both</Content><Content>beds, the chairs, and most of the floor was strewn with an assortment of</Content><Content>miscellaneous articles. On the dressing-table was a tray with the</Content><Content>remains of tea. Over a large cabin trunk bent a girl of fourteen. She</Content><Content>straightened herself as she heard footsteps.</Content><Content>Alas! alas! for Ulyth's illusions. The enchanting vision of the prairie</Content><Content>flower faded, and Rona Mitchell stood before her in solid fact. Solid</Content><Content>was the word for it--no fascinating cinema heroine this, but an</Content><Content>ordinary, well-grown, decidedly plump damsel with brown elf locks, a</Content><Content>ruddy sunburnt complexion, and a freckled nose.</Content><Content>Where, oh, where, were the delicate features, the fairy-like figure, and</Content><Content>the long rich clustering curls of Rose of the Wilderness? Ulyth stood</Content><Content>for a moment gazing as one dazed; then, with an effort, she remembered</Content><Content>her manners and introduced herself.</Content><Content>"Proud to meet you at last," replied the new-comer heartily. "You and</Content><Content>I've had a friendship switched on for us ready-made, so to speak. I</Content><Content>liked your letters awfully. Glad they've put us in together."</Content><Content>"Did--did you have a nice journey?" stammered Ulyth.</Content><Content>It was a most conventional enquiry, but the only thing she could think</Content><Content>of to say.</Content><Content>"Beastly! It was rough or hot all the time, and we didn't get much fun</Content><Content>on board. Wasn't it a sell? Too disappointing for words! Mrs. Perkins,</Content><Content>the lady who had charge of me coming over, was just a Tartar. Nothing I</Content><Content>did seemed to suit her somehow. I bet she was glad to see the last of</Content><Content>me. Then I was sea-sick, and when we got into the hot zone--my, how bad</Content><Content>I was! My face was just skinned with sunburn, and the salt air made it</Content><Content>worse. I'd not go to sea again for pleasure, I can tell you. I say, I'll</Content><Content>be glad to get my things fixed up here."</Content><Content>"This is your bed and your side of the room," returned Ulyth hastily,</Content><Content>collecting some of the articles which had been flung anywhere, and</Content><Content>hanging them in Rona's wardrobe; "Miss Moseley makes us be very tidy.</Content><Content>She'll be coming round this evening to inspect."</Content><Content>Rona whistled.</Content><Content>"Guess she'll drop on me pretty often then! No one's ever called</Content><Content>neatness my strong point. Are those photos on the mantelpiece your home</Content><Content>folks? I'm going to look at them. What a lot of things you've got:</Content><Content>books, and albums, and goodness knows what! I'll enjoy turning them over</Content><Content>when I've time."</Content><Content>At half-past eight that night a few members of the Lower Fifth, putting</Content><Content>away books in their classroom, stopped to compare notes.</Content><Content>"Well, what do you think of your adorable one, Ulyth?" asked Stephanie</Content><Content>Radford, a little spitefully. "You're welcome to her company so far as</Content><Content>I'm concerned."</Content><Content>"Rose of the Wilderness, indeed!" mocked Merle Denham.</Content><Content>"Your prairie rose is nothing but a dandelion!" remarked Christine</Content><Content>Crosswood.</Content><Content>"I never heard anyone with such an awful laugh," said Lizzie Lonsdale.</Content><Content>"Don't!" implored Ulyth tragically. "I've had the shock of my life.</Content><Content>She's--oh, she's too terrible for words! Her voice makes me cringe. And</Content><Content>she pawed all my things. She snatched up my photos, and turned over my</Content><Content>books with sticky fingers; she even opened my drawers and peeped</Content><Content>inside."</Content><Content>"What cheek!"</Content><Content>"Oh, she hasn't the slightest idea of how to behave herself! She asked</Content><Content>me a whole string of the most impertinent questions: what I'd paid for</Content><Content>my clothes, and how long they'd have to last me. She's unbearable. Yes,</Content><Content>absolutely impossible. Ugh! and I've got to sleep in the same room with</Content><Content>her to-night."</Content><Content>"Poor martyr, it's hard luck," sympathized Lizzie. "Why did you write</Content><Content>and ask the Rainbow to put you together? It was rather buying a pig in a</Content><Content>poke, wasn't it?"</Content><Content>"I never dreamt she'd be like this. It sounded so romantic, you see,</Content><Content>living on a huge farm, and having two horses to ride. I shall go to Miss</Content><Content>Bowes, first thing to-morrow morning, and ask to have her moved out of</Content><Content>my room. I only wish there was time to do it this evening. Oh, why did I</Content><Content>ever write to her and make her want to come to this school?"</Content><Content>"Poor old Ulyth! You've certainly let yourself in for more than you</Content><Content>bargained for," laughed the girls, half sorry for her and half amused.</Content><Content>Next morning, after breakfast, the very instant that Miss Bowes was</Content><Content>installed in her study, a "rap-tap-tap" sounded on her door.</Content><Content>"Come in!" she called, and sighed as Ulyth entered, for she had a shrewd</Content><Content>suspicion of what she was about to hear.</Content><Content>"Please, Miss Bowes, I'm sorry to have to ask a favour, but may Rona be</Content><Content>changed into another dormitory?"</Content><Content>"Why, Ulyth, you wrote to me specially and asked if you might have her</Content><Content>for a room-mate!"</Content><Content>"Yes, I did; but I hadn't seen her then. I thought she'd be so</Content><Content>different."</Content><Content>"Isn't it a little too soon to judge? You haven't known her twenty-four</Content><Content>hours yet."</Content><Content>"I know as much of her as I ever want to. Oh, Miss Bowes, she's</Content><Content>dreadful! I'll never like her. I can't have her in my room--I simply</Content><Content>can't!"</Content><Content>There was a shake, suggestive of tears, in Ulyth's voice. Her eyes</Content><Content>looked heavy, as if she had not slept. Miss Bowes sighed again.</Content><Content>"Rona mayn't be exactly what you imagined, but you must remember in</Content><Content>what different circumstances she has been brought up. I think she has</Content><Content>many good qualities, and that she'll soon improve. Now let us look at</Content><Content>the matter from her point of view. You have been writing to her</Content><Content>constantly for two years. She has come here specially to be near you.</Content><Content>You are her only friend in a new and strange country where she is many</Content><Content>thousand miles away from her own home. You gave her a cordial invitation</Content><Content>to England, and now, because she does not happen to realize your quite</Content><Content>unfounded expectations, you want to back out of all your obligations to</Content><Content>her. I thought you were a girl, Ulyth, who kept her promises."</Content><Content>Ulyth fingered the corner of the tablecloth nervously for a moment, then</Content><Content>she burst out:</Content><Content>"I can't, Miss Bowes, I simply can't. If you knew how she grates upon</Content><Content>me! Oh, it's too much! I'd rather have a bear cub or a monkey for a</Content><Content>room-mate! Please, please don't make us stop together! If you won't move</Content><Content>her, move me! I'd sleep in an attic if I could have it to myself."</Content><Content>"You must stay where you are until the end of the week. You owe that to</Content><Content>Rona, at any rate. Afterwards I shall not force you, but leave it to</Content><Content>your own good feeling. I want you to think over what I have been saying.</Content><Content>You can come on Sunday morning and tell me your decision."</Content><Content>"I know what the answer will be," murmured Ulyth, as she went from the</Content><Content>room.</Content><Content>She was very angry with Miss Bowes, with Rona, and with herself for her</Content><Content>own folly.</Content><Content>"It's ridiculous to expect me to take up this savage," she argued. "And</Content><Content>too bad of Miss Bowes to make out that I'm breaking my word. Oh dear!</Content><Content>what am I to write home to Mother? How can I tell her? I believe I'll</Content><Content>just send her a picture post card, and only say Rona has come, and no</Content><Content>more. Miss Bowes has no right to coerce me. I'll make my own friends.</Content><Content>No, I've quite made up my mind she shan't cram Rona down my throat. To</Content><Content>have that awful girl eternally in my bedroom--I should die!"</Content><Content>After all her heroics it was a terrible come-down for poor Ulyth now the</Content><Content>actual had taken the place of the sentimental. Her class-mates could not</Content><Content>forbear teasing her a little. It was too bad of them; but then they had</Content><Content>resented her entire pre-appropriation of the new-comer, and, moreover,</Content><Content>had one or two old scores from last term to pay off. Ulyth began to</Content><Content>detest the very name of "the Prairie Flower". She wondered how she could</Content><Content>ever have been so silly.</Content><Content>"I ought to have been warned," she thought, trying to throw the blame on</Content><Content>to somebody else. "No one ever suggested she'd be like this. The editor</Content><Content>of the magazine really shouldn't have persuaded us to write. It's all</Content><Content>his fault in the beginning."</Content><Content>Though the rest of the girls were scarcely impressed with Rona's</Content><Content>personality, they were not utterly repelled.</Content><Content>"She's rather pretty," ventured Lizzie Lonsdale. "Her eyes are the</Content><Content>bluest I've ever seen."</Content><Content>"And her teeth are so white and even," added Beth Broadway. "She looks</Content><Content>jolly when she smiles."</Content><Content>"Perhaps she'll smarten up soon," suggested Addie Knighton. "That blue</Content><Content>dress suits her; it just matches her eyes."</Content><Content>To Ulyth's fastidious taste Rona's clothes looked hopelessly ill-cut and</Content><Content>colonial, especially as her room-mate put them on anyhow, and seemed to</Content><Content>have no regard at all for appearances. A girl who did not mind whether</Content><Content>she looked really trim, spruce and smart, must indeed have spent her</Content><Content>life in the backwoods.</Content><Content>"Didn't you even have a governess in New Zealand?" she ventured one day.</Content><Content>She did not encourage Rona to talk, but for once her curiosity overcame</Content><Content>her dislike of the high-pitched voice.</Content><Content>"Couldn't get one to stop up-country, where we were. Mrs. Barker, our</Content><Content>cowman's wife, looked after me ever since Mother died. She was the only</Content><Content>woman about the place. One of our farm helps taught me lessons. He was a</Content><Content>B.A. of Oxford, but down on his luck. Dad said I'd seem queer to English</Content><Content>girls. I don't know that I care."</Content><Content>Though Rona might not be possessed of the most delicate perceptions, she</Content><Content>nevertheless had common sense enough to realize that Ulyth did not</Content><Content>receive her with enthusiasm.</Content><Content>"I suppose you're disappointed in me?" she queried. "Dad said you would</Content><Content>be, but I laughed at him. Pity if our ready-made friendship turned out a</Content><Content>misfit! I think you're no end! Dad said I'd got to copy you; it'll take</Content><Content>me all my time, I expect. Things are so different here from home."</Content><Content>Was there a suspicion of a choke in the words?</Content><Content>Ulyth had a sudden pang of compunction. Unwelcome as her companion was</Content><Content>to her, she did not wish to be brutal.</Content><Content>"You mustn't get home-sick," she said hastily. "You'll shake down here</Content><Content>in time. Everyone finds things strange at school just at first. I did</Content><Content>myself."</Content><Content>"I guess you were never as much a fish out of water as me, though,"</Content><Content>returned Rona, and went whistling down the passage.</Content><Content>Ulyth tried to dismiss her from her thoughts. She did not intend to</Content><Content>worry over Rona more than she could possibly help. Fortunately they were</Content><Content>not together in class, for Rona's entrance-examination papers had not</Content><Content>reached the standard of the Lower Fifth, and she had been placed in IV</Content><Content>B.</Content><Content>Ulyth was interested in her school-work. She stood well with her</Content><Content>teachers, and was an acknowledged force in her form. She came from a</Content><Content>very refined and cultured home, where intellectual interests were</Content><Content>cultivated both by father and mother. Her temperament was naturally</Content><Content>artistic; she was an omnivorous reader, and could devour anything in the</Content><Content>shape of literature that came her way. The bookcase in her dormitory was</Content><Content>filled with beautiful volumes, mostly Christmas and birthday gifts. She</Content><Content>rejoiced in their soft leather bindings or fine illustrations with a</Content><Content>true book-lover's enthusiasm. It was her pride to keep them in daintiest</Content><Content>condition. Dog-ears or thumb-marks were in her opinion the depths of</Content><Content>degradation. Ulyth had ambitions also, ambitions which she would not</Content><Content>reveal to anybody. Some day she planned to write a book of her own. She</Content><Content>had not yet fixed on a subject, but she had decided just what the cover</Content><Content>was to be like, with her name on it in gilt letters. Perhaps she might</Content><Content>even illustrate it herself, for her love of art almost equalled her love</Content><Content>of literature; but that was still in the clouds, and must wait till she</Content><Content>had chosen her plot. In the interim she wrote verses and short stories</Content><Content>for the school magazine, and her essays for Miss Teddington were</Content><Content>generally returned marked "highly creditable".</Content><Content>This term Ulyth intended to study hard. It was a promotion to be in the</Content><Content>Upper School; she was beginning several new subjects, and her interest</Content><Content>in many things was aroused. It would be a delightful autumn as soon as</Content><Content>she had got rid of this dreadful problem, at present the one serious</Content><Content>obstacle to her comfort. But in the meantime it was only Friday, and</Content><Content>till at least the following Monday she would be obliged to endure her</Content><Content>uncongenial presence in her bedroom.</Content><Content>CHAPTER III</Content><Content>Round the Camp-fire</Content><Content>It was the first Saturday of the term. So far the girls had been kept</Content><Content>busily occupied settling down to work in their fresh forms, and trying</Content><Content>to grow accustomed to Miss Teddington's new time-tables. Now, however,</Content><Content>they were free to relax and enjoy themselves in any way they chose. Some</Content><Content>were playing tennis, some had gone for a walk with Miss Moseley, a few</Content><Content>were squatting frog-like on boulders in the midst of the stream, and</Content><Content>others strolled under the trees in the grove.</Content><Content>"Thank goodness the weather's behaving itself!" said Mary Acton, who,</Content><Content>with a few other members of the Lower Fifth, was sitting on the trunk of</Content><Content>a fallen oak. "Do you remember last council? It simply poured. The</Content><Content>thing's no fun if one can't have a real fire."</Content><Content>"It'll burn first-rate to-night," returned Lizzie Lonsdale. "There's a</Content><Content>little wind, and the wood'll be dry."</Content><Content>"That reminds me I haven't found my faggot yet," said Beth Broadway</Content><Content>easily.</Content><Content>"Girl alive! Then you'd better go and look for one, or you'll be all in</Content><Content>a scramble at the last!"</Content><Content>"Bother! I'm too comfy to move."</Content><Content>"Nice Wood-gatherer you'll look if you come empty-handed!"</Content><Content>"I'd appropriate half your lot first, Lizzikins!"</Content><Content>"Would you, indeed? I'd denounce you, and you'd lose your rank and be</Content><Content>degraded to a candidate again."</Content><Content>"Oh, you mean, stingy miser!"</Content><Content>"Not at all. It's the wise and foolish virgins over again. I shan't have</Content><Content>enough for myself and you. I've a lovely little stack--just enough for</Content><Content>one--reposing--no, I'd better not tell you where. Don't look so hopeful.</Content><Content>You're not to be trusted."</Content><Content>"What are you talking about?" asked Rona Mitchell, who had wandered up</Content><Content>to the group. "Why are some of you picking up sticks? I saw a girl over</Content><Content>there with quite a bundle just now. You might tell me."</Content><Content>So far Rona had not been well received in her own form, IV B. She was</Content><Content>older than her class-mates, and they, instead of attempting to initiate</Content><Content>her into the ways of the Woodlands girls on this holiday afternoon, had</Content><Content>scuttled off and left her to fend for herself. She looked such an odd,</Content><Content>wistful, lonely figure that Lizzie Lonsdale's kind heart smote her. She</Content><Content>pushed the other girls farther along the tree-trunk till they made a</Content><Content>grudging space for the new-comer.</Content><Content>"I'm a good hand at camp-fires, if you want any help," continued Rona,</Content><Content>seating herself with alacrity. "I've made 'em by the dozen at home, and</Content><Content>cooked by them too. Just let me know where you want it, and I'll set to</Content><Content>work."</Content><Content>"You wouldn't be allowed," said Beth bluntly. "This fire is a very</Content><Content>special thing. Only Wood-gatherers may bring the fuel. No one else is</Content><Content>eligible."</Content><Content>"Why on earth not?"</Content><Content>"Oh, I can't bother to explain now! It would take too long. You'll find</Content><Content>out to-night. Girls, I'm going in!"</Content><Content>"Turn up here at dusk if you want to know, and bring a cup with you,"</Content><Content>suggested Lizzie, with a half-ashamed effort at friendliness, as she</Content><Content>followed her chums.</Content><Content>"You bet I'll turn up! Rather!"</Content><Content>That evening, just after sunset, little groups of girls began to collect</Content><Content>round an open green space in the glade. They came quietly and with a</Content><Content>certain sense of discipline. A stranger would have noticed that if any</Content><Content>loud tone or undue hilarity made itself heard, it was instantly and</Content><Content>firmly repressed by one or two who seemed in authority. That the meeting</Content><Content>was more in the nature of a convention than a mere pleasure-gathering</Content><Content>was evident both from the demeanour of the assemblage and from the</Content><Content>various badges pinned on the girls' coats. No teacher was present, but</Content><Content>there was an air of general expectancy, as if the coming of somebody</Content><Content>were awaited. To the pupils at The Woodlands this night's ceremony was a</Content><Content>very special occasion, for it was the autumn reunion of the Camp-fire</Content><Content>League, an organization which, originally of American birth, had been</Content><Content>introduced at the instigation of Miss Teddington, and had taken great</Content><Content>root in the school. Any girl was eligible as a candidate, but before she</Content><Content>could gain admission to even the initial rank she had to prove herself</Content><Content>worthy of the honour of membership, and pass successfully through her</Content><Content>novitiate.</Content><Content>The organizer and leader of the branch which to-night was to celebrate</Content><Content>its third anniversary was a certain Mrs. Arnold, a charming young</Content><Content>American lady who lived in the neighbourhood. She had been an</Content><Content>enthusiastic supporter of the League in Pennsylvania before her</Content><Content>marriage, and was delighted to pass on its traditions to British</Content><Content>schoolgirls. Her winsome personality made her a prime favourite at The</Content><Content>Woodlands, where her influence was stronger even than she imagined. Miss</Content><Content>Teddington, though it was she who had asked Mrs. Arnold to institute and</Content><Content>take charge of the meetings, had the discretion to keep out of the</Content><Content>League herself, realizing that the presence of teachers might be a</Content><Content>restraint, and that the management was better left in the hands of a</Content><Content>trustworthy outsider.</Content><Content>To become an authorized Camp-fire member was an ambition with most of</Content><Content>the girls, and spurred many on to greater efforts than they would</Content><Content>otherwise have attempted. All looked forward to the meetings, and there</Content><Content>could be no greater punishment for certain offences than a temporary</Content><Content>withdrawal of League privileges.</Content><Content>This September, after the long summer holiday, the reunion seemed of</Content><Content>even more than ordinary importance.</Content><Content>The sun had set, the last gleam of the afterglow had faded, and the</Content><Content>glade had grown full of dim shadows by the time everybody was present in</Content><Content>the grove. The gentle rustle of the leafy boughs overhead, and the</Content><Content>persistent tumbling rush of the stream, seemed like a faint orchestral</Content><Content>accompaniment of Nature for the ceremonial.</Content><Content>"Is it a Quakers' Meeting or a Freemasons' Lodge? You're all very mum,"</Content><Content>asked Rona, whom curiosity had led out with the others.</Content><Content>"Sh-sh! We're waiting for our 'Guardian of the Fire'," returned Ulyth,</Content><Content>trying to suppress the loudness of the high-pitched voice. "Mrs.</Content><Content>Arnold's generally very punctual. Oh, there! I believe I hear her</Content><Content>ringing her bicycle bell now. I'm going down the field to meet her."</Content><Content>Ulyth regarded Mrs. Arnold with that intense adoration which a girl of</Content><Content>fifteen often bestows on a woman older than herself. She ran now through</Content><Content>the wood, hoping she might be in time to catch her idol on the drive and</Content><Content>have just a few precious moments with her before she was joined by the</Content><Content>others. There were many things she wanted to pour into her friend's</Content><Content>ready ears, but she knew it would be impossible to monopolize her as</Content><Content>soon as the rest of the girls knew of her arrival. She fled as on wings,</Content><Content>therefore, and had the supreme satisfaction of being the first in the</Content><Content>field. Mrs. Arnold, young, very fair, graceful, and golden-haired,</Content><Content>looked a picture in her blue cycling costume as she leaned her machine</Content><Content>against a tree and greeted her enthusiastic admirer.</Content><Content>"Oh, you darling! I've such heaps to tell you!" began Ulyth, clasping</Content><Content>her tightly by the arm. "Rona Mitchell has come, and she's the most</Content><Content>awful creature! I never was so disappointed in my life. Don't you</Content><Content>sympathize with me, when I expected her to be so ripping? She's absolute</Content><Content>backwoods!"</Content><Content>"Yes, I've heard all about her. Poor child! She must have had a strange</Content><Content>training. It's time indeed she began to learn something."</Content><Content>"She's not learned anything in New Zealand. Oh, her voice will just</Content><Content>grate on you! And her manners! She's hopeless! Everything she does and</Content><Content>says is wrong. And to think she's been foisted on to me, of all people!"</Content><Content>"Poor child!" repeated Mrs. Arnold. ("Which of us does she mean?"</Content><Content>thought Ulyth.) "She's evidently raw material. Every diamond needs</Content><Content>polishing. What an opportunity for a Torch-bearer!"</Content><Content>Ulyth dropped her friend's arm suddenly. It was not at all the answer</Content><Content>she had expected. Moreover, at least a dozen girls had come running up</Content><Content>and were claiming their chief's attention. In a species of triumphant</Content><Content>procession Mrs. Arnold was escorted into the glade and installed on her</Content><Content>throne of state, a seat made of logs and decorated with ferns. Everyone</Content><Content>clustered round to welcome her, and for the moment she was the centre of</Content><Content>an enthusiastic crowd. Ulyth followed more slowly. She was feeling</Content><Content>disturbed and put out. What did Mrs. Arnold mean? Surely not----? A</Content><Content>sudden thought had flashed into her mind but she thrust it away</Content><Content>indignantly. Oh no, that was quite impossible! It was outrageous of</Content><Content>anybody to make the suggestion. And yet--and yet--the uneasy voice that</Content><Content>had been haunting her for the last four days began to speak with even</Content><Content>more vehemence. With a sigh of relief she heard the signal given for</Content><Content>"Attention", and cast the matter away from her for the moment. Every eye</Content><Content>was fixed on their leader. The ceremony was about to begin.</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold rose, and in her clear, sweet voice proclaimed:</Content><Content>"The Guardian of the Fire calls on the Wood-gatherers to bring their</Content><Content>fuel."</Content><Content>At once a dozen girls came forward, each dragging a tolerably large</Content><Content>bundle of brushwood. They deposited these in a circle, saluted, and</Content><Content>retired.</Content><Content>"Fire-makers, do your work!" commanded the leader.</Content><Content>Eight girls responded, Ulyth among the number, and seizing the</Content><Content>brushwood, they built it deftly into a pile. All stood round, waiting in</Content><Content>silence while their chief struck a match and applied a light to some</Content><Content>dried leaves and bracken that had been placed beneath. The flame rose up</Content><Content>like a scarlet ribbon, and in a few moments the dry fuel was ablaze and</Content><Content>crackling. The gleam lighting up the glade displayed a picturesque</Content><Content>scene. The boles of the trees might have been the pillars in some</Content><Content>ancient temple, with the branches for roof. Close by the cascade of the</Content><Content>stream leapt white against a background of dim darkness. The harvest</Content><Content>moon, full and golden, was rising behind the crest of Cwm Dinas. An owl</Content><Content>flew hooting from the wood higher up the glen. Mrs. Arnold stood waiting</Content><Content>until the bonfire was well alight, then she turned to the expectant</Content><Content>girls.</Content><Content>"I've no need to tell most of you why we have met here to-night; but for</Content><Content>the benefit of a few who are new-comers to The Woodlands I should like</Content><Content>briefly to explain the objects of the Camp-fire League. The purpose of</Content><Content>the organization is to show that the common things of daily life are the</Content><Content>chief means of beauty, romance, and adventure, to cultivate the outdoor</Content><Content>habit, and to help girls to serve the community--the larger home--as</Content><Content>well as the individual home. In these ultra-modern times we must</Content><Content>especially devote ourselves to the service of the country, and try by</Content><Content>every means in our power to make our League of some national use. First</Content><Content>let us repeat together the rules of the Camp-fire League:</Content><Content>    "'1. Seek beauty.</Content><Content>      2. Give service.</Content><Content>      3. Pursue knowledge.</Content><Content>      4. Be trustworthy.</Content><Content>      5. Hold on to health.</Content><Content>      6. Glorify work.</Content><Content>      7. Be happy.'</Content><Content>"Seeking beauty includes more than looking for superficial adornment.</Content><Content>Beauty is in all life, in Nature, in people, in the love of one's heart,</Content><Content>in virtue and a radiant disposition. The value of service depends</Content><Content>largely upon the attitude of mind of the one rendering it. Joy in the</Content><Content>performance of some needed service in behalf of parent, teacher,</Content><Content>friend, or country constitutes a part of the very essence of goodness,</Content><Content>and multiplies the good already abiding in the heart. This is the third</Content><Content>anniversary of the founding of a branch of the League at The Woodlands.</Content><Content>So far the work has been very encouraging, and I am glad to say that</Content><Content>to-night we have candidates eligible for all three ranks. It shall now</Content><Content>be the business of the meeting formally to admit them. Candidates for</Content><Content>Wood-gatherers, present yourselves!"</Content><Content>Six of the younger girls came forward and saluted.</Content><Content>"Can you repeat, and will you promise to obey, the seven rules of the</Content><Content>Camp-fire law?"</Content><Content>Each responded audibly in the affirmative.</Content><Content>"Then you are admitted to the initial rank of Wood-gatherers, you are</Content><Content>awarded the white badge of service, and may sign your names as accepted</Content><Content>members of the League."</Content><Content>The six retired to make way for a higher grade, and eight other girls</Content><Content>stepped into the firelight.</Content><Content>"Candidates for Fire-makers, you have passed three months with good</Content><Content>characters as Wood-gatherers, and you have proved your ability to render</Content><Content>first aid, keep accounts, tie knots, and prepare and serve a simple</Content><Content>meal; you have each committed to memory some good poem, and have</Content><Content>acquainted yourself with the career of some able, public-spirited woman.</Content><Content>Having thus shown your wish to serve the community, repeat the</Content><Content>Fire-maker's desire."</Content><Content>And all together the eight girls chanted:</Content><Content>    "As fuel is brought to the fire</Content><Content>     So I purpose to bring</Content><Content>     My strength,</Content><Content>     My ambition,</Content><Content>     My heart's desire,</Content><Content>     My joy,</Content><Content>     And my sorrow</Content><Content>     To the fire</Content><Content>     Of human kind.</Content><Content>     For I will tend</Content><Content>     As my fathers have tended</Content><Content>     And my fathers' fathers</Content><Content>     Since time began,</Content><Content>     The fire that is called</Content><Content>     The love of man for man,</Content><Content>     The love of man for God."</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold said a few kind words to each as she pinned on their red</Content><Content>badges. Only novices who had stood the various tests with credit were</Content><Content>raised to the honour of the second rank. Those who had failed must</Content><Content>perforce continue as Wood-gatherers for another period of three months.</Content><Content>There remained one further and higher rank, only attainable after six</Content><Content>months' ardent and trustworthy service as Fire-makers. To-night three</Content><Content>girls were to be admitted to its privileges, and Helen Cooper, Doris</Content><Content>Deane, and Ulyth Stanton presented themselves. With grave faces they</Content><Content>repeated the Torch-bearer's desire:</Content><Content>     "That light which has been given to me I desire to pass undimmed to</Content><Content>     others."</Content><Content>Ulyth kissed Mrs. Arnold's pretty hand as the long-coveted yellow badge</Content><Content>was fastened on to her dress, side by side with the Union Jack. She was</Content><Content>so glad to be a Torch-bearer at last. She had become a candidate when</Content><Content>the League was first founded three years ago, and all that time she had</Content><Content>been slowly working towards the desired end of the third rank. One or</Content><Content>two slips had hindered her progress, but last term she had made a very</Content><Content>special effort, and it was sweet to meet with her reward. Torch-bearers</Content><Content>were mostly to be found among the Sixth and Upper Fifth; she was the</Content><Content>only girl in V B who had won so high a place. She touched the yellow</Content><Content>ribbon tenderly. It meant so much to her.</Content><Content>Now that the serious business of the meeting was over, the fun was about</Content><Content>to begin. The big camp-kettle was produced and filled at the stream, and</Content><Content>then set to boil upon the embers. Cups and spoons made their appearance.</Content><Content>Cocoa and biscuits were to be the order of the evening, followed by as</Content><Content>many songs, dances, and games as time permitted. Squatting on the grass,</Content><Content>the girls made a circle round their council-fire. Marjorie Earnshaw, one</Content><Content>of the Sixth, had brought her guitar, and struck the strings every now</Content><Content>and then as an earnest of the music she intended to bring from it later</Content><Content>on. Everybody was in a jolly mood, and inclined to laugh at any pun,</Content><Content>however feeble. Mrs. Arnold, always bright and animated, surpassed</Content><Content>herself, and waxed so amusing that the circle grew almost hysterical.</Content><Content>The Wood-gatherers, whose office it was to mix the cocoa, supplied cup</Content><Content>after cup, and refilled the kettle so often that they ventured to air</Content><Content>the time-honoured joke that the stream would run dry, for which ancient</Content><Content>chestnut they were pelted with pebbles.</Content><Content>When at last nobody could even pretend to be thirsty any longer, the</Content><Content>cups were rinsed in the pool and stacked under a tree, and the concert</Content><Content>commenced. Part-songs and catches sounded delightful in the open air,</Content><Content>and solos, sung to the accompaniment of Marjorie's guitar, were equally</Content><Content>effective. The girls roared the choruses to popular national ditties,</Content><Content>and special favourites were repeated again and again. Several</Content><Content>step-dances were executed, and had a weird effect in the unsteady light</Content><Content>of the waning fire. Mrs. Arnold, who was a splendid elocutionist, gave a</Content><Content>recitation on an incident in the American War, and was enthusiastically</Content><Content>encored. The moon had risen high in the sky, and was peeping through the</Content><Content>tree-tops as if curious to see who had invaded so sylvan a spot as the</Content><Content>glade. The silver beams caught the ripples of the stream and made the</Content><Content>shadows seem all the darker.</Content><Content>It was a glorious beginning for the new term, as everybody agreed, and</Content><Content>an earnest of the fun that was in store later on.</Content><Content>"We shan't be able to camp out next meeting, but we'll have high jinks</Content><Content>in the hall," purred Beth Broadway.</Content><Content>"Yes; Mrs. Arnold says she has a lovely programme for the winter, and</Content><Content>we're to have candles instead of fuel," agreed Lizzie Lonsdale, who had</Content><Content>been raised that evening to the rank of Fire-maker.</Content><Content>"Trust Mrs. Arnold to find something new for us to do!" murmured Ulyth,</Content><Content>looking fondly in the direction of her ideal.</Content><Content>"My gracious, I call this meeting no end!" piped a cheerful voice in her</Content><Content>ear; and Rona, smiling with all-too-obtrusive friendliness, plumped down</Content><Content>by her side. "You've good times here, and no mistake! I think I'll be a</Content><Content>candidate myself next, if that's the game to play. You're a</Content><Content>high-and-mighty one, aren't you? Let's have a look at your badge!"</Content><Content>"If you dare to touch it!" flared Ulyth, putting up her hand to guard</Content><Content>her cherished token.</Content><Content>"Why, I wouldn't do it any harm, I promise you; I wouldn't finger it! It</Content><Content>means something, doesn't it? I didn't quite catch what it was. You might</Content><Content>tell me. How'm I ever to get to know if you won't?"</Content><Content>Rona's clear blue eyes, unconsciously wistful, looked straight into</Content><Content>Ulyth's. The latter sprang to her feet without a word. The force of her</Content><Content>own motto seemed suddenly to be revealed to her. She rushed away into</Content><Content>the shadow of the trees to think it over for herself.</Content><Content>     "That light which has been given to me I desire to pass undimmed to</Content><Content>     others."</Content><Content>Those were the words she had repeated so earnestly less than an hour</Content><Content>ago. And she was already about to make them a mockery! Yes, that was</Content><Content>what Mrs. Arnold had meant. She had known it all the time, but she would</Content><Content>not acknowledge it even to her innermost heart. Was this what was</Content><Content>required from a Torch-bearer--to pass on her own refinement and culture</Content><Content>to a girl whose crudities offended every particle of her fastidious</Content><Content>taste? Ulyth sat down on a stone and wept hot, bitter, rebellious tears.</Content><Content>She understood only too well why she had been so miserable for the last</Content><Content>three days. She had disliked Miss Bowes for hinting that she was not</Content><Content>keeping her word, and had told herself that she was a much-tried and</Content><Content>ill-used person.</Content><Content>"I must do it, I must, or fail at the very beginning!" she sobbed. "I</Content><Content>know what Mother would say. It's got to be; if for nothing else, for the</Content><Content>sake of the school. A Torch-bearer mustn't shirk and break her pledge.</Content><Content>Oh, how I shall loathe it, hate it! Ulyth Stanton, do you realize what</Content><Content>you're undertaking? Your whole term's going to be spoilt."</Content><Content>The big bell in the tower was clanging its summons to return, with</Content><Content>short, impatient strokes. Everybody joined hands in a circle round the</Content><Content>ashes of the camp-fire, to sing in a low chant the good-night song of</Content><Content>the League and "God Save the Queen". Mr. Arnold, who had come to fetch</Content><Content>his wife, was sounding his hooter as a signal on the drive. The</Content><Content>evening's fun was over. Regretfully the girls collected cups, spoons,</Content><Content>and kettle, and made their way back to the house.</Content><Content>On Sunday morning Ulyth, with a very red face, marched into the study,</Content><Content>and announced:</Content><Content>"Miss Bowes, I've been having a tussle. One-half of me said: 'Don't</Content><Content>have Rona in your room at any price!' and the other half said: 'Let her</Content><Content>stop!' I've decided to keep her."</Content><Content>"I knew you would, when you'd thought it over," beamed Miss Bowes.</Content><Content>"Are all New Zealanders the same?" asked Ulyth. "I've not met one</Content><Content>before."</Content><Content>"Certainly not. Most of them are quite as cultured and up-to-date as</Content><Content>ourselves. There are splendid schools in New Zealand, and excellent</Content><Content>opportunities for study of every kind. Poor Rona, unfortunately, has had</Content><Content>to live on a farm far away from civilization, and her education and</Content><Content>welfare in every respect seem to have been utterly neglected. Don't take</Content><Content>her as a type of New Zealand! But she'll soon improve if we're all</Content><Content>prepared to help her. I'm glad you're ready to be her real friend."</Content><Content>"I'll try my best!" sighed Ulyth.</Content><Content>CHAPTER IV</Content><Content>A Blackberry Foray</Content><Content>Having made up her mind to accept the responsibility which fate, through</Content><Content>the agency of the magazine editor, had thrust upon her, Ulyth,</Content><Content>metaphorically speaking, set her teeth, and began to take Rona seriously</Content><Content>in hand. Being ten months older than her protégée, in a higher form,</Content><Content>and, moreover, armed with full authority from Miss Bowes, she assumed</Content><Content>command of the bedroom, and tried to regulate the chaos that reigned on</Content><Content>her comrade's side of it. Rona submitted with an air of amused good</Content><Content>nature to have her clothes arranged in order in her drawers, her shoes</Content><Content>put away in the cupboard, and her toilet articles allotted places on her</Content><Content>washstand and dressing-table. She even consented to give some thought to</Content><Content>her personal appearance, and borrowed Ulyth's new manicure set.</Content><Content>"You're mighty particular," she objected. "What does it all matter? Miss</Content><Content>Bowes gave me such a talking-to, and said I'd got to do exactly what you</Content><Content>told me; and before I came, Dad rubbed it into me to copy you for all I</Content><Content>was worth, so I suppose I'll have to try. I guess you'll find it a job</Content><Content>to civilize me though." And her eyes twinkled.</Content><Content>Ulyth thought, with a mental sigh, that she probably would find it "a</Content><Content>job".</Content><Content>"No one bothered about it at home," Rona continued cheerfully. "Dad did</Content><Content>say sometimes I was growing up a savage, but Mrs. Barker never cared.</Content><Content>She let me do what I liked, so long as I didn't trouble her. She was no</Content><Content>lady! We couldn't get a lady to stay at our out-of-the-way block. Dad</Content><Content>used to be a swell in England once, but that was before I was born."</Content><Content>Ulyth began to understand, and her disgust changed to a profound pity. A</Content><Content>motherless girl who had run wild in the backwoods, her father probably</Content><Content>out all day, her only female guide a woman of the backwoods, whose</Content><Content>manners were presumably of the roughest--this had been Rona's training.</Content><Content>No wonder she lacked polish!</Content><Content>"When I compare her home with my home and my lovely mother," thought</Content><Content>Ulyth, "yes--there's certainly a vast amount to be passed on."</Content><Content>The other girls, who had never expected her to keep Rona in her bedroom,</Content><Content>were inclined to poke fun at the proceeding.</Content><Content>"Your bear cub will need training before you teach her to dance," said</Content><Content>Stephanie Radford tauntingly.</Content><Content>"She has no parlour tricks at present," sniggered Addie Knighton.</Content><Content>"Are you posing as Valentine and Orson?" laughed Gertie Oliver. Gertrude</Content><Content>had been Ulyth's room-mate last term, and felt aggrieved to be</Content><Content>superseded.</Content><Content>"I call her the cuckoo," said Mary Acton. "Do you remember the young one</Content><Content>we found last spring, sprawling all over the nest, and opening its huge,</Content><Content>gaping beak?"</Content><Content>In spite of her ignorance and angularities there was a certain charm</Content><Content>about the new-comer. When the sunburn caused by her sea-voyage had</Content><Content>yielded to a course of treatment, it left her with a complexion which</Content><Content>put even that of Stephanie Radford, the acknowledged school beauty, in</Content><Content>the shade. The coral tinge in Rona's cheeks was, as Doris Deane</Content><Content>enviously remarked, "almost too good to look natural", and her blue eyes</Content><Content>with the big pupils and the little dark rims round the iris shone like</Content><Content>twinkling stars when she laughed. That ninnying laugh, to be sure, was</Content><Content>still somewhat offensive, but she was trying to moderate it, and only</Content><Content>when she forgot did it break out to scandalize the refined atmosphere of</Content><Content>The Woodlands; the small white even teeth which it displayed, and two</Content><Content>conspicuous dimples, almost atoned for it. The brown hair was brushed</Content><Content>and waved and its consequent state of new glossiness was a very distinct</Content><Content>improvement on the former elf locks. In the sunshine it took tones of</Content><Content>warm burnt sienna, like the hair of the Madonna in certain of Titian's</Content><Content>great pictures. Lessons, alack! were uphill work. Rona was naturally</Content><Content>bright, but some subjects she had never touched before, and in others</Content><Content>she was hopelessly backward. The general feeling in the school was that</Content><Content>"The Cuckoo", as they nicknamed her, was an experiment, and no one could</Content><Content>guess exactly what she would grow into.</Content><Content>"She's like one of those queer beasties we dug up under the yew-tree</Content><Content>last autumn," suggested Merle Denham. "Those wriggling transparent</Content><Content>things, I mean. Don't you remember? We kept them in a box, and didn't</Content><Content>know whether they'd turn out moths, or butterflies, or earwigs, or</Content><Content>woodlice!"</Content><Content>"They turned into cockchafer beetles, as a matter of fact," said Ulyth</Content><Content>drily.</Content><Content>"Well, they were horrid enough in all conscience. I don't like Nature</Content><Content>study when it means hoarding up creepy-crawlies."</Content><Content>"You're not obliged to take it."</Content><Content>"I don't this year. I've got Harmony down on my time-table instead."</Content><Content>"You'll miss the rambles with Teddie."</Content><Content>"I don't care. I'll play basket-ball instead."</Content><Content>"How about the blackberry foray?"</Content><Content>"Oh, I'm not going to be left out of that! It's not specially Nature</Content><Content>study. I've put my name down with Miss Moseley's party."</Content><Content>The inmates of The Woodlands were fond of jam. It was supplied to them</Content><Content>liberally, and they consumed large quantities of it at tea-time. To help</Content><Content>to meet this demand, blackberrying expeditions were organized during the</Content><Content>last weeks of September, and the whole school turned out in relays to</Content><Content>pick fruit. A dozen girls and a mistress generally composed a party,</Content><Content>which was not confined to any particular form, but might include any</Content><Content>whose arrangements for practising or special lessons allowed them to go.</Content><Content>Dates and particulars of the various rambles planned, with the names of</Content><Content>the mistresses who were to be leaders, were pinned up on the</Content><Content>notice-board, and the girls might put their names to them as they liked,</Content><Content>so long as each list did not exceed twelve.</Content><Content>On Saturday afternoon Miss Moseley headed a foray in the direction of</Content><Content>Porth Powys Falls, and Merle, Ulyth, Rona, Addie, and Stephanie were</Content><Content>members of her flock.</Content><Content>"I'm glad I managed to get into this party," announced Merle, "because I</Content><Content>always like Porth Powys better than Pontvoelas or Aberceiriog. It's a</Content><Content>jollier walk, and the blackberries are bigger and better. I was the very</Content><Content>last on the list, so I'd luck. Alice had to go under Teddie's wing. I'd</Content><Content>rather have Mosie than Teddie!"</Content><Content>"So would I," agreed Ulyth. "I scribbled my name the very first of all.</Content><Content>Just got a chance to do it as I was going to my music-lesson, before</Content><Content>everyone else made a rush for the board. Porth Powys will be looking no</Content><Content>end to-day."</Content><Content>Swinging their baskets, the girls began to climb a narrow path which ran</Content><Content>alongside the stream up the glen. Some of them were tempted to linger,</Content><Content>and began to gather what blackberries could be found; but Miss Moseley</Content><Content>had different plans.</Content><Content>"Come along! It's ridiculous to waste our labour here," she exclaimed.</Content><Content>"All these bushes have been well picked over already. We'll walk</Content><Content>straight on till we come to the lane near the ruined cottage, then we</Content><Content>shall get a harvest and fill our baskets in a third of the time. Quick</Content><Content>march!"</Content><Content>There was sense in her remarks, so Merle abandoned several half-ripe</Content><Content>specimens for which she had been reaching and joined the file that was</Content><Content>winding, Indian fashion, up the path through the wood. Over a high,</Content><Content>ladder-like stile they climbed, then dropped down into the gorge to</Content><Content>where a small wooden bridge spanned the stream. They loved to stand here</Content><Content>looking at the brown rushing water that swirled below. The thick trees</Content><Content>made a green parlour, and the continual moisture had carpeted the woods</Content><Content>with beautiful verdant moss which grew in close sheets over the rocks.</Content><Content>Up again, by an even steeper and craggier track, they climbed the</Content><Content>farther bank of the gorge, and came out at last on to the broad</Content><Content>hill-side that overlooked the Craigwen Valley.</Content><Content>Here was scope for a leader; the track was so overgrown as to be almost</Content><Content>indistinguishable, and ran across boggy land, where it was only too easy</Content><Content>to plunge over one's boot-tops in oozy peat. Miss Moseley found the way</Content><Content>like a pioneer; she had often been there before and remembered just what</Content><Content>places were treacherous and just where it was possible to use a swinging</Content><Content>bough for a help. By following in her footsteps the party got safely</Content><Content>over without serious wettings, and sat down to take breath for a few</Content><Content>minutes on some smooth, glacier-ground rocks that topped the ridge they</Content><Content>had been scaling. They were now at some height above the valley, and the</Content><Content>prospect was magnificent. For at least ten miles they could trace the</Content><Content>windings of the river, and taller and more distant mountain peaks had</Content><Content>come into view.</Content><Content>"Some people say that Craigwen Valley's very like the Rhine,"</Content><Content>volunteered Ulyth. "It hasn't any castles, of course, except at</Content><Content>Llangarmon, but the scenery's just as lovely."</Content><Content>"Nice to think it's British then," rejoiced Merle. "Wales can hold its</Content><Content>own in the way of mountains and lakes. People have no need to go abroad</Content><Content>for them. What's New Zealand like, Rona?"</Content><Content>"We've ripping rivers there," replied the Cuckoo, "bigger than this by</Content><Content>lots, and with tree-ferns up in the bush. This isn't bad, though, as far</Content><Content>as it goes. What's that place over across on the opposite hill?"</Content><Content>"Where the light's shining? Oh, that's Llanfairgwyn! There's a village</Content><Content>and a church. We've only been once. It's rather a long way, because you</Content><Content>have to cross the ferry at Glanafon before you can get to the other side</Content><Content>of the river."</Content><Content>"And what's that big white house in the trees, with the flag?"</Content><Content>"That's Plas Cafn. It's _the_ place in the neighbourhood, you know,"</Content><Content>said Stephanie, fondly fingering her necklace.</Content><Content>"I don't know. How should I?"</Content><Content>"Well, you know it now, at any rate."</Content><Content>"Does it belong to toffs?"</Content><Content>"It belongs to Lord and Lady Glyncraig. They live there for part of the</Content><Content>year."</Content><Content>"Oh!" said Rona. She put her chin on her hand and surveyed the distant</Content><Content>mansion for several moments in silence. "I reckon they're stuck up,"</Content><Content>she remarked at last.</Content><Content>"I believe they're considered nice. I've never spoken to them," replied</Content><Content>Ulyth.</Content><Content>"I have," put in Stephanie complacently. "I went to tea once at Plas</Content><Content>Cafn. It was when Father was Member for Rotherford. Lord Glyncraig knew</Content><Content>him in Parliament, of course, and he happened to meet Father and me just</Content><Content>when we were walking past the gate at Plas Cafn, and asked us in to</Content><Content>tea."</Content><Content>Merle, Addie, and Ulyth smiled. This visit, paid four years ago, was the</Content><Content>standing triumph of Stephanie's life. She never forgot, nor allowed any</Content><Content>of her schoolfellows to forget, that she had been entertained by the</Content><Content>great people of the neighbourhood.</Content><Content>"He wasn't Lord Glyncraig then; he was only Sir John Mitchell, Baronet.</Content><Content>He's been raised to a peerage since," said Merle, willing to qualify</Content><Content>some of the glory of Stephanie's reminiscences.</Content><Content>"We don't grow peers in Waitoto, or baronets either, for the matter of</Content><Content>that," observed Rona. "I don't guess they're wanted out with us. We'd</Content><Content>have no place in the bush for a Lord Glyncraig."</Content><Content>"You'd better claim acquaintance with him, as your name's Mitchell too.</Content><Content>How proud he'd be of the honour!" teased Addie.</Content><Content>Coral flooded the whole of the Cuckoo's face. She had begun to</Content><Content>understand the difference between her rough upbringing and the refined</Content><Content>homes of the other girls, and she resented the sneers that were often</Content><Content>made at her expense.</Content><Content>"Our butcher at home is Joseph Mitchell," hinnied Merle.</Content><Content>"Mitchell's a common enough name," said Ulyth. "I know two families in</Content><Content>Scotland and some people at Plymouth all called Mitchell. They're none</Content><Content>of them related to each other, and probably not to Merle's butcher or to</Content><Content>Lord Glyncraig."</Content><Content>"Nor to me," said Rona. "I'm a democrat, and I glory in it. Stephanie's</Content><Content>welcome to her grand friends if she likes them."</Content><Content>"I do like them," sighed Stephanie plaintively. "I love aristocratic</Content><Content>people and nice houses and things. Why shouldn't I? You needn't grin,</Content><Content>Addie Knighton; you'd know them yourself if you could. When I come out</Content><Content>I'd like to be presented at Court, and go to a ball where the people are</Content><Content>all dukes and duchesses and earls and countesses. It would be worth</Content><Content>while dancing with a duke, especially if he wore the Order of the</Content><Content>Garter!"</Content><Content>"Until that glorious day comes you'll have to dance with poor little me</Content><Content>for a partner," giggled Merle.</Content><Content>"Aren't you all rested? We shall get no blackberries if we don't hurry</Content><Content>on," called Miss Moseley from the other end of the rock.</Content><Content>Everybody scrambled up immediately and set out again over the</Content><Content>bracken-covered hill-side. Another half-mile and they had reached the</Content><Content>bourne of their expedition. The narrow track through the gorse and fern</Content><Content>widened suddenly into a lane, a lane with very high, unmortared walls,</Content><Content>over which grew a variety of bramble with a particularly luscious</Content><Content>fruit. Every connoisseur of blackberries knows what a difference there</Content><Content>is between the little hard seedy ones that commonly flourish in the</Content><Content>hedges and the big juicy ones with the larger leaves. Nature had been</Content><Content>prodigal here, and a bounteous harvest hung within easy reach.</Content><Content>"They are as big as mulberries--and oh, such heaps and heaps!" exclaimed</Content><Content>Addie ecstatically. "No, Merle, you wretch, this is my branch! Don't</Content><Content>poach, you wretch! Go farther on, can't you!"</Content><Content>"I wish we could send the jam to the hospital when it's made," sighed</Content><Content>Merle.</Content><Content>The party spread itself out; some of the girls climbed to the top of the</Content><Content>wall, so that they could reach what grew on the sunnier side, and a few</Content><Content>skirted round over a gate into a field, where a ruined cottage was also</Content><Content>covered with brambles. They worked down the lane by slow degrees,</Content><Content>picking hard as they went. At the end a sudden rushing roar struck upon</Content><Content>the ear, and without even waiting for a signal from Miss Moseley the</Content><Content>girls with one accord hopped over a fence, and ran up a slight incline.</Content><Content>The voice of the waterfall was calling, and the impulse to obey was</Content><Content>irresistible. At the top of the slope they stopped, for they had reached</Content><Content>a natural platform that overlooked the gorge. The scene rivalled one of</Content><Content>the beauty-spots of Switzerland. The Porth Powys stream, flowing between</Content><Content>precipitous rocks, fell two hundred feet in a series of four splendid</Content><Content>cascades. The rugged crags on either side were thickly covered with a</Content><Content>forest of fir and larch, and here and there a taller stone-pine reared</Content><Content>its darker head above the silvery green. Dashing, roaring, leaping,</Content><Content>shouting, the water poured down in a never-ceasing volume: the white</Content><Content>spray rose up in clouds, wetting the girls' faces; the sound was like an</Content><Content>endless chorus of hallelujahs.</Content><Content>"Porth Powys is in fine form to-day. There must have been rain up in the</Content><Content>mountains last night," remarked Ulyth. "What do you think of it, Rona?"</Content><Content>"It's a champion! I'm going to climb down there and get at the edge."</Content><Content>"No, you won't!" said Miss Moseley sharply. "Nobody is to go a single</Content><Content>step nearer. You must all come back into the lane now, and get on with</Content><Content>blackberry-picking. Your baskets are only half full yet."</Content><Content>Very reluctantly the girls followed. The fall exercised a fascination</Content><Content>over them, and they could have stayed half an hour watching its white</Content><Content>swirl. They did not wish, however, to earn the reputation of slackers.</Content><Content>Two other parties had gone out blackberrying that afternoon, and there</Content><Content>would be keen competition as to which would bring back the most pounds.</Content><Content>They set to work again, therefore, with enthusiasm, counting stained</Content><Content>fingers and scratches as glorious wounds earned in the good cause. Rona</Content><Content>picked with zeal, but she had a preoccupied look on her face.</Content><Content>"Say, I liked that waterfall," she remarked to Ulyth. "One can't see</Content><Content>anything of it down in this old lane. I'm going to get a better view."</Content><Content>"You mustn't go off on your own," commanded Ulyth. "Miss Moseley will</Content><Content>report you if you do!"</Content><Content>"Don't excite yourself. I only said I was going to get a better view.</Content><Content>It's quite easy."</Content><Content>Rona put her basket in a safe place, and with the aid of a hazel bush</Content><Content>climbed to the top of the wall. Apparently the prospect did not satisfy</Content><Content>her.</Content><Content>"I'm going a stave higher still. Keep your hair on!" she shouted down to</Content><Content>Ulyth, and began swarming up the bole of a huge old oak-tree that</Content><Content>abutted on the wall. She was strong and active as a boy, and had soon</Content><Content>scrambled to where the branches forked. A mass of twisted ivy hung here,</Content><Content>and raising herself with its aid, she stood on an outstretched bough.</Content><Content>"It's ripping! I can see a little bit of the fall; I'll see it better if</Content><Content>I get over on to that other branch."</Content><Content>"Take care!" called Miss Moseley from below.</Content><Content>Rona started. She had not known the mistress was so near. The movement</Content><Content>upset her decidedly unstable balance; she clutched hard at the ivy, but</Content><Content>it gave way in her fingers; there was a sudden crash and a smothered</Content><Content>shriek.</Content><Content>White as a ghost, Miss Moseley climbed the wall, expecting to find the</Content><Content>prostrate form of her pupil on the other side. To her surprise she saw</Content><Content>nothing of the sort. Near at hand, however, came a stifled groan.</Content><Content>"Rona, where are you?" shrieked the distracted governess.</Content><Content>"Here," spluttered the voice of the Cuckoo; "inside the tree. The</Content><Content>beastly old thing's rotten, and I've tumbled to the very bottom of the</Content><Content>trunk!"</Content><Content>"Are you hurt?"</Content><Content>"No, nothing to speak of."</Content><Content>"Here's a pretty go!" murmured the girls, who all came running at the</Content><Content>sound of shouts. "How's she going to get out again?"</Content><Content>"Can't you climb up?" urged Miss Moseley.</Content><Content>"No, I can't stir an inch; I'm wedged in somehow."</Content><Content>What was to be done? The affair waxed serious. Miss Moseley, with a</Content><Content>really heroic effort, and much help from the girls, managed to scale the</Content><Content>tree and look down into the hollow trunk. She could just see Rona's</Content><Content>scared face peeping up at her many feet below.</Content><Content>"Can you put up your hand and let me pull you?"</Content><Content>"No; I tell you I'm wedged as tight as a sardine."</Content><Content>"We shall have to send for help then. May and Kathleen, run as quickly</Content><Content>as you can down the lane. There's a farm at the bottom of the hill. Tell</Content><Content>them what's the matter."</Content><Content>"I hope to goodness they'll understand English!" murmured Merle.</Content><Content>"Will I have to stop here always?" demanded a tragic voice within the</Content><Content>tree. "Shall you be able to feed me, or will I have to starve? How long</Content><Content>does it take to die of hunger?"</Content><Content>"You won't die just yet," returned Miss Moseley, laughing a little in</Content><Content>spite of herself. "We'll get you out in course of time."</Content><Content>"I guess I'd better make my will, though. Has anybody got a pencil and</Content><Content>paper, and will they please write it down and send it home? I want to</Content><Content>leave my saddle to Pamela Higson, and Jake is to have the bridle and</Content><Content>whip--I always liked him better than Billy, though I pretended I didn't.</Content><Content>Jane Peters may have my writing-desk--much she writes, though!--and</Content><Content>Amabel Holt my old doll. That's all I've left in New Zealand. Ulyth can</Content><Content>take what I've got at school--'twon't be any great shakes to her, I</Content><Content>expect. You didn't tell me how long it takes to die!"</Content><Content>"Cheer up! There's not the slightest danger," Miss Moseley continued to</Content><Content>assure her.</Content><Content>"It's all very well to say 'cheer up' when you're standing safe on the</Content><Content>top," said the gloomy voice of the imprisoned dryad. "It feels a</Content><Content>different matter when you're boxed up tight with tree all round you.</Content><Content>It's jolly uncomfortable. Where are the girls?"</Content><Content>"Here's one," replied Ulyth, climbing the tree to relieve poor Miss</Content><Content>Moseley, who gladly retired in her favour. "I'm going to stay and talk</Content><Content>to you till somebody comes to get you out. Oh, here are May and Kathleen</Content><Content>at last! What a fearful time they've been!"</Content><Content>The two messengers came panting back with many excuses for their delay.</Content><Content>It was a long way down the lane to the farm, and when they arrived there</Content><Content>they had considerable difficulty in explaining their errand. No one</Content><Content>could understand English except a little boy, who was only half-able to</Content><Content>translate their remarks into Welsh. They had at length made the farmer</Content><Content>realize what had happened, and he had promised to come at once. In the</Content><Content>course of a few minutes they were followed by David Jones and his son,</Content><Content>Idwal, bearing a rope, an axe, and a saw, and looking rather dismayed at</Content><Content>the task in store for them. It proved indeed a matter of considerable</Content><Content>difficulty to rescue Rona without hurting her; a portion of the</Content><Content>tree-trunk was obliged to be sawn away before she could obtain</Content><Content>sufficient room to help to free herself, and it was only after an hour's</Content><Content>hard work that she stood at last in safety on the ground.</Content><Content>"How do you feel?" asked Miss Moseley anxiously, fearing broken bones or</Content><Content>a sprain from the final effort of extraction.</Content><Content>"Well, I guess it's taken the bounce out of me. I'm as stiff as a</Content><Content>rheumatic cat! Oh, I'll get back to school somehow, don't alarm</Content><Content>yourself! I'm absolutely starving for tea. Good-bye, you wood-demon; you</Content><Content>nearly finished me!" and Rona shook her fist at the offending oak-tree</Content><Content>as a parting salute.</Content><Content>"She called it demon to rhyme with lemon!" gurgled Addie, almost sobbing</Content><Content>with mirth as she followed, holding Merle's arm. "The Cuckoo will cause</Content><Content>me to break a blood-vessel some day. It hurts me most dreadfully to</Content><Content>laugh. I've got a stitch in my side. Oh dear! I wonder whatever she'll</Content><Content>go and do next?"</Content><Content>CHAPTER V</Content><Content>On Sufferance</Content><Content>    "Scratch, scratch, scratch,</Content><Content>     Scratch went the old black hen!</Content><Content>     Every fowl that scrapes in the barn</Content><Content>     Can scratch as well as your pen!"</Content><Content>So sang Rona, bounding noisily one afternoon into No. 3, Room 5, and</Content><Content>popping her hands from behind over Ulyth's eyes as the latter sat</Content><Content>writing at a table near the window.</Content><Content>"What are you always scratching away for? Can't you finish your work at</Content><Content>prep.? Why don't you come downstairs and play basket-ball? You're mighty</Content><Content>studious all of a sudden. What have you got here?"</Content><Content>Ulyth flushed crimson with annoyance, and turned her sheets of foolscap</Content><Content>hastily over to hide them from her room-mate's prying eyes.</Content><Content>"You're not to touch my papers, Rona! I've told you that before."</Content><Content>"Well, I wasn't touching them. Looking's not touching, anyway. What are</Content><Content>you doing? It's queer taste to sit scribbling here half your spare</Content><Content>time."</Content><Content>"What I was doing is my own concern, and no business of yours."</Content><Content>"Now you're riled," said the Cuckoo, sitting down easily on her bed. "I</Content><Content>didn't mean any harm. I always seem sticking my foot into it somehow."</Content><Content>Ulyth sighed. Nobody in the school realized how much she had to put up</Content><Content>with from her irrepressible room-mate, whose hearty voice, extraordinary</Content><Content>expressions, and broad notions of fun grated upon her sensitive nature.</Content><Content>Rona did not appreciate in the least the heroic sacrifice that Ulyth was</Content><Content>making. It had never occurred to her that she might be placed in another</Content><Content>dormitory, and that she only remained on sufferance in No. 3. She</Content><Content>admired Ulyth immensely, and was quite prepared to take her as a model,</Content><Content>but at present the copy was very far indeed from the original. The</Content><Content>mistresses had instituted a vigorous crusade against Rona's loud voice</Content><Content>and unconventional English, and she was really making an effort to</Content><Content>improve; but the habits of years are not effaced in a few weeks, and she</Content><Content>still scandalized the authorities considerably. Ulyth could tolerate her</Content><Content>when she kept to her own side of the bedroom, but to have meddlesome</Content><Content>fingers interfering with her private possessions was the last straw to</Content><Content>her burden of endurance.</Content><Content>"Do you understand?" she repeated emphatically. "You're not to touch my</Content><Content>papers at all!"</Content><Content>"All serene! I won't lay a finger on them--honest--sure!" returned the</Content><Content>Cuckoo, chanting her words to the air of "Swanee River", and drumming an</Content><Content>accompaniment on the bedpost. "What d'you think Stephanie called me just</Content><Content>now? She said I was an unlicked cub."</Content><Content>"Oh, surely she didn't! Are you certain?"</Content><Content>"Heard her myself. She said it to my face and tittered. You bet I'll pay</Content><Content>her out somehow. Miss Stephanie Radford needs taking down a peg. Oh,</Content><Content>don't alarm yourself, I'll do it neatly! There'll be no clumsy bungling</Content><Content>about it. Well, if you won't go down and play basket-ball I shall. It's</Content><Content>more fun than sitting up here."</Content><Content>As the door banged behind Rona, Ulyth heaved an ecstatic "Thank</Content><Content>goodness!" She sat for a few moments trying to regain her composure</Content><Content>before she recommenced the writing at which she had been interrupted.</Content><Content>The manuscript on which she was engaged was very precious. She had set</Content><Content>herself no less a task than to write a book. The subject had come to her</Content><Content>suddenly one morning as she lay awake in bed, and she regarded it as an</Content><Content>inspiration. She would make a story about The Woodlands, and bring in</Content><Content>all the girls she knew. It was no use struggling with a historical plot</Content><Content>or a romance of the war--she had tried these, and stuck fast in the</Content><Content>first chapters; it was better to employ the material close at hand, and</Content><Content>weave her tale from the every-day incidents which happened in the</Content><Content>school. So she had begun, and though she floundered a little at the</Content><Content>difficulty of transferring her impressions to paper, she was making</Content><Content>distinct progress.</Content><Content>"I'd never dare to have it published, of course," she ruminated. "Still,</Content><Content>it's a beginning, and I shall like to read it over to myself. I think</Content><Content>there are some rather neat bits in it, especially that shot at Addie</Content><Content>and Stephie. How wild they'd be if they knew! But there's no fear of</Content><Content>that. I'll take good care nobody finds out."</Content><Content>When to make time to go on with her literary composition was the</Content><Content>difficulty. It was hard to snatch even an occasional half-hour during</Content><Content>the day. Where there is a will, however, there is generally also a way,</Content><Content>and Ulyth hit upon the plan of getting up very early in the morning and</Content><Content>writing while Rona was still asleep. The Cuckoo never stirred until the</Content><Content>seven o'clock bell rang, when she would awake noisily, with many yawns</Content><Content>and stretchings of arms, so Ulyth flattered herself that her secret was</Content><Content>absolutely safe.</Content><Content>Where to hide the precious papers was another problem. She did not dare</Content><Content>to put them in any of her drawers, her desk would not lock, and her</Content><Content>little jewel-box was too small to contain them.</Content><Content>The fireplace in the bedroom had an old-fashioned chimney-piece that was</Content><Content>fitted with a loose wooden mantel-board, from which hung a border of</Content><Content>needlework. It was quite easy to lift up this board and slip the papers</Content><Content>between it and the chimney-piece; the border completely screened the</Content><Content>hiding-place, and, except at a spring-cleaning, the arrangement was not</Content><Content>likely to be disturbed. Ulyth congratulated herself greatly upon her</Content><Content>ingenuity. It was interesting to have a secret which nobody even</Content><Content>guessed. She often looked at the chimney-piece, and chuckled as she</Content><Content>thought of what lay concealed there.</Content><Content>The days were rapidly closing in now, and the time between tea and</Content><Content>preparation, which only a few weeks ago was devoted to a last game of</Content><Content>tennis or a run by the stream, was perforce spent by the schoolroom</Content><Content>fire. It was only a short interval, not long enough to make any</Content><Content>elaborate occupation worth while, so the girls sat knitting in the</Content><Content>twilight and chatting until the bell rang for evening work.</Content><Content>One afternoon, when tea was finished, Ulyth, instead of joining the</Content><Content>others as usual, walked upstairs to put away some specimens in the</Content><Content>Museum. She passed V B classroom as she did so, and heard smothered</Content><Content>peals of mirth issuing from behind the half-closed door.</Content><Content>"What are they doing?" she thought. "I believe I'll go and see." But</Content><Content>catching Rona's laugh above the rest, she changed her mind, walked on,</Content><Content>and bestowed her fossils carefully in a spare corner of one of the</Content><Content>cases. Meanwhile, the group assembled round the fire in V B were</Content><Content>enjoying themselves. The room was growing dusk, but, seated on the</Content><Content>hearthrug, Addie Knighton could see quite sufficiently to read aloud</Content><Content>extracts from a document she was perusing, extracts to which the others</Content><Content>listened with thrilling interest, interspersed with comments.</Content><Content>"'The girls of the Oaklands'," so she read, "'were a rather peculiar and</Content><Content>miscellaneous set, especially those in the Lower Fifth. Scarcely any of</Content><Content>them could be called pretty--'" ("Oh! oh!" howled the attentive circle.)</Content><Content>"'One of them, Valerie Chadford, imagined herself so, and gave herself</Content><Content>fearful airs in consequence; she was very set up at knowing smart</Content><Content>people, and often bragged about it.'" ("I'll never forgive her, never!"</Content><Content>screamed Stephanie.) "'The twins, Pearl and Doris, were fat, stodgy</Content><Content>girls, who wore five-and-a-halfs in shoes and had twenty-seven-inch</Content><Content>waists.'" ("Oh! Won't Merle and Alice be just frantic when they hear?")</Content><Content>"'But even they were more interesting than Nellie Clacton, who usually</Content><Content>sat with her mouth open, as if she was trying to catch flies.'" ("Does</Content><Content>she mean me?" gasped Mary Acton indignantly.) "'Florence Tulliver was</Content><Content>inclined to be snarly, and often said mean things about other people</Content><Content>behind their backs.'" ("I'll say something now!" declared Gertrude</Content><Content>Oliver.) "'And Annie Ryton was----'" but here Addie broke off abruptly</Content><Content>and exploded.</Content><Content>"Go on! Go on!" commanded the girls.</Content><Content>"It's too lovely!" spluttered Addie. "O--ho--ho! So that's what she</Content><Content>thinks of me, is it?"</Content><Content>"Read it, can't you?"</Content><Content>"Here, give the paper to me!"</Content><Content>"No, no! I'll go on--but--I didn't know my eyes were like faded</Content><Content>gooseberries, and my hair like dried seaweed!"</Content><Content>"Has she described herself!" asked Stephanie.</Content><Content>"I haven't come to it yet. Oh yes! here we are, farther on: 'Our</Content><Content>heroine, Morvyth Langton, was an unusually----'"</Content><Content>But here Addie stopped abruptly, for a blazing little fury stood in the</Content><Content>doorway.</Content><Content>"Addie Knighton, how dare you? How dare you? Give me that paper this</Content><Content>instant!"</Content><Content>"No, no! It's much too interesting. Let go! Don't be silly! How can you?</Content><Content>Oh, what a shame!" as Ulyth in her anger tore the manuscript across and</Content><Content>flung it into the fire.</Content><Content>"Whew! Now you've gone and done it!" whistled Rona.</Content><Content>Ulyth was holding down the last flaming fragment with the poker. When it</Content><Content>had expired she turned to the guilty circle. "Who took my papers from my</Content><Content>bedroom?"</Content><Content>Her voice was sharp, and her eyes fixed full on Rona.</Content><Content>"I didn't touch them. I never laid so much as a finger on them,"</Content><Content>protested the Cuckoo.</Content><Content>"But you told someone where they were?"</Content><Content>Rona winked in reply. Yes, alas! winked consciously and deliberately.</Content><Content>(It was well for her that Miss Moseley was not in the room.)</Content><Content>"I knew you'd got something there," she admitted. "Were you such an</Content><Content>innocent as to think I never saw you scribbling away hard in the early</Content><Content>mornings? Why, I was foxing! I used to watch you while I was snoring,</Content><Content>and nearly died with laughing because you never found me out."</Content><Content>If eyes could slay, Ulyth's would have finished Rona at that moment. But</Content><Content>Addie Knighton, whose suspension of mirth had been merely a species of</Content><Content>temporary paralysis, now relapsed into a choking series of guffaws, in</Content><Content>which the others joined boisterously.</Content><Content>"I can't--get--over--seaweed--and faded gooseberries!" crowed Addie</Content><Content>hysterically.</Content><Content>"I don't catch flies with my open mouth!" shouted Mary Acton, suspending</Content><Content>her knitting in her indignation.</Content><Content>"Will somebody please measure the twins' waists?" bleated Christine.</Content><Content>"I didn't say it was meant for any of you. If the cap fits, put it on.</Content><Content>Listeners hear no good of themselves, and no more do people who read</Content><Content>what isn't intended for them. It serves you all right, so there!" and</Content><Content>Ulyth flounced out of the room.</Content><Content>She ran straight up to her bedroom, and burst into tears. It was such a</Content><Content>tragi-comedy ending to her literary ambition. She would rather the girls</Content><Content>had been more indignant than that they had laughed so much.</Content><Content>"I'll never write another line again," she resolved; and then she</Content><Content>thought of the binding she had always intended to have on her first</Content><Content>published book, and wept harder.</Content><Content>"Ulyth," said the Cuckoo, stealing in rather shamefacedly, "I'm really</Content><Content>frightfully sorry if you're riled. I didn't know you cared all that much</Content><Content>about those old papers. I told Addie, as a joke, and she went and poked</Content><Content>them out. I think they were fine. It was a shame to burn them. Can't you</Content><Content>write them over again?"</Content><Content>"Never!" Ulyth replied, wiping her eyes. "Rona, you don't realize what</Content><Content>damage you've done. There! oh yes, I'll forgive you, but if you want to</Content><Content>keep friends with me, don't go and do anything of the sort again, that's</Content><Content>all!"</Content><Content>Ulyth felt a little shy of meeting her class-mates after their discovery</Content><Content>of the very unflattering description she had written of them, but the</Content><Content>girls were good-natured and did not bear malice. They treated the whole</Content><Content>affair as an intense joke, and even took to calling one another by the</Content><Content>assumed names of the story. They composed extra portions, including a</Content><Content>lurid description of Ulyth herself, illustrated by rapid sketches on the</Content><Content>black-board. The disappointed authoress took it with what calm she could</Content><Content>muster. She knew they meant to tease, and the fewer sparks they could</Content><Content>raise from her the sooner they would desist and let the matter drop. It</Content><Content>would probably serve as a target for Addie's wit till the end of the</Content><Content>term, unless the excitement of the newly formed ambulance class chased</Content><Content>it from her memory. The Woodlanders were trying to do their duty by</Content><Content>their country, and all the girls were enthusiastically practising</Content><Content>bandaging.</Content><Content>"I wish we'd some real patients to bind up," sighed Merle one day, as V</Content><Content>B took its turn under Nurse Griffith's instructions.</Content><Content>"I'd be sorry for them if they were left to your tender mercies,"</Content><Content>retorted Mavis, who had been posing as patient. "My arm's sore yet with</Content><Content>your vigorous measures."</Content><Content>"What nonsense! I was as gentle as a lamb."</Content><Content>"A curious variety of lamb then, with a wolf inside."</Content><Content>"I believe The Woodlands would make a gorgeous hospital," suggested</Content><Content>Addie hopefully. "When we're through our course we might have some real</Content><Content>patients down and nurse them."</Content><Content>"Don't you think it! The Rainbow won't carry ambulance lessons as far as</Content><Content>that!"</Content><Content>CHAPTER VI</Content><Content>Quits</Content><Content>Ulyth, brushing her hair before the looking-glass one morning, hummed</Content><Content>cheerily.</Content><Content>"You seem in spirits," commented Rona, from the washstand. "It's more</Content><Content>than I am. Miss Lodge was a pig yesterday. She said my dictation was a</Content><Content>disgrace to the school, and I'd got to stop in during the interval this</Content><Content>morning and write out all the wrong words a dozen times each. It's too</Content><Content>sickening! I'd no luck yesterday. Phyllis Chantrey had my book to</Content><Content>correct, and her writing and mine are such opposite poles, we daren't</Content><Content>try it on."</Content><Content>"Try what on?" asked Ulyth, pausing with the brush in her hand.</Content><Content>"Why, the exchange dodge, you know."</Content><Content>"I don't know."</Content><Content>"Don't you take dictation in V B? Well, in our form we get it twice a</Content><Content>week, and Miss Lodge makes us correct each other's books. We make it up</Content><Content>to try and exchange with a girl whose writing's pretty like one's own;</Content><Content>then, you see, we can alter things neatly, and allow full marks. It</Content><Content>generally works, but it didn't yesterday."</Content><Content>Ulyth's face was a study.</Content><Content>"You mean to tell me you correct each other's mistakes!"</Content><Content>"Why not?" said Rona, not the least abashed. "Miss Lodge never finds</Content><Content>out."</Content><Content>Ulyth collapsed into a chair. What was she to do with such a girl?</Content><Content>"Don't you know it's the most atrocious cheating?"</Content><Content>"Is it? Why, the whole form does it," returned the Cuckoo unconcernedly.</Content><Content>"Then they're abominable little wretches, and don't deserve to be</Content><Content>candidates for the Camp-fire League. I'm thoroughly ashamed of them.</Content><Content>Have they no sense of honour?"</Content><Content>The Cuckoo was looking perplexed.</Content><Content>"Ulyth Stanton, you're always rounding something new on me," she sighed.</Content><Content>"I can't keep up with you. I keep my hair tidy now, and don't leave my</Content><Content>things lying round the room, and I try to give a sort of twitter instead</Content><Content>of laughing, and I've dropped ever so many words you object to, and</Content><Content>practise walking down the passage with a book on my head. What more do</Content><Content>you want?"</Content><Content>"A great deal," said Ulyth gravely. "Didn't you learn honour at home?"</Content><Content>"Catch Mrs. Barker!"</Content><Content>"But surely your father----?"</Content><Content>"I saw so little of Dad. He was out all day, and sometimes off for weeks</Content><Content>together at our other block. When he was at home he didn't care to be</Content><Content>bothered overmuch."</Content><Content>An amazed pity was taking the place of Ulyth's indignation. This was,</Content><Content>indeed, fallow ground. Mrs. Arnold's comment flashed across her mind:</Content><Content>"What an opportunity for a Torch-bearer!"</Content><Content>"I don't want to be turned into a prig," urged the Cuckoo.</Content><Content>"You needn't. There's a certain amount of slang and fun that's</Content><Content>allowable, but _noblesse oblige_ must always come first. You don't</Content><Content>understand French yet? Well, never mind. All that matters is that you</Content><Content>simply must realize, Rona--do listen, please--that all of us here,</Content><Content>including you, mustn't--couldn't--cheat at lessons. For your own sake,</Content><Content>and for the sake of the school, you must stop it."</Content><Content>"You think a lot of the school!"</Content><Content>"And quite right too! The school stands to us for what the State does to</Content><Content>grown-up people. We've got to do our best to keep the tone up. Cheating</Content><Content>brings it down with a run. It's as bad as tearing up treaties."</Content><Content>"Go ahead. Rub it in," returned the Cuckoo, beginning to whistle a</Content><Content>trifle defiantly.</Content><Content>She thought the matter over, nevertheless, and returned to the subject</Content><Content>that night when they were going to bed.</Content><Content>"Ulyth, I told the girls exactly what you said about them. My gracious,</Content><Content>you should have seen their faces! Boiled lobsters weren't in it. That</Content><Content>hit about the Camp-fire Guild seemed specially to floor them. I don't</Content><Content>fancy, somehow, there'll be any more correcting done in dictation.</Content><Content>You've touched them up no end."</Content><Content>"I'm extremely glad if what I said has brought them to their senses,"</Content><Content>declared Ulyth.</Content><Content>Rona got on tolerably well among her comrades, but there was one</Content><Content>exception. With Stephanie she was generally in a state of guerrilla</Content><Content>warfare. The latter declared that the vulgar addition to the school was</Content><Content>an outrage on the feelings of those who had been better brought up.</Content><Content>Stephanie had ambitions towards society with a big S, and worshipped</Content><Content>titles. She would have liked the daughter of a duke for a schoolfellow,</Content><Content>but so far no member of the aristocracy had condescended to come and be</Content><Content>educated at The Woodlands. Stephanie felt injured that Miss Bowes and</Content><Content>Miss Teddington should have accepted such a girl as Rona, and lost no</Content><Content>opportunity of showing that she thought the New Zealander very far below</Content><Content>the accepted standard. The Cuckoo's undoubted good looks were perhaps</Content><Content>another point in her disfavour. The school beauty did not easily yield</Content><Content>place to a rival, and though she professed to consider Rona's complexion</Content><Content>too high-coloured, she had a sneaking consciousness that it was superior</Content><Content>to her own.</Content><Content>During the summer holidays Stephanie had taken part in a pageant that</Content><Content>was held in aid of a charity near her home. As Queen of the Roses she</Content><Content>had occupied a rather important position, and her portrait, in her</Content><Content>beautiful fancy costume, had appeared in several of the leading ladies'</Content><Content>newspapers. Stephanie's features were good, and the photograph had been</Content><Content>a very happy one--"glorified out of all knowledge" said some of the</Content><Content>girls; so the photographer had exhibited it in his window, and</Content><Content>altogether more notice had been taken of it than was perhaps salutary</Content><Content>for the original. Stephanie had brought a copy back to school, and it</Content><Content>now adorned her bedroom mantelpiece. She was never tired of descanting</Content><Content>upon the pageant, and telling about all the aristocratic people who had</Content><Content>come to see it. According to her account the very flower of the</Content><Content>neighbourhood had been present, and had taken special notice of her. A</Content><Content>girl who had so lately consorted with the county could not be expected</Content><Content>to tolerate a tyro from the backwoods. Stephanie was too well brought up</Content><Content>to allow herself to be often openly rude; her taunts were generally</Content><Content>ingeniously veiled, but they were none the less aggravating for that.</Content><Content>The Cuckoo might be callow in some respects, but in others she was very</Content><Content>much up-to-date. Though she would look obtuse, and pretend not to</Content><Content>understand, as a matter of fact not a gibe was lost upon her, and she</Content><Content>kept an exact account of the score.</Content><Content>One morning, early in December, Miss Teddington, who was distributing</Content><Content>the contents of the postbag, handed Stephanie a small parcel. It was</Content><Content>only a few days after the latter's birthday, and, supposing it to be a</Content><Content>belated present, the mistress did not ask the usual questions by which</Content><Content>she regulated her pupils' correspondence. The letters were always given</Content><Content>out immediately after breakfast, and the girls took them upstairs to</Content><Content>read in their dormitories during the quarter of an hour in which they</Content><Content>made their beds and tidied their rooms. This morning, just as Ulyth was</Content><Content>shaking her pillow, Rona came in, chuckling to herself. The Cuckoo's</Content><Content>eyes twinkled like stars.</Content><Content>"D'you want some sport?" she asked. "If you do, come with me, and have</Content><Content>the time of your life!"</Content><Content>Ulyth put down the pillow, and hesitated. Fifteen minutes was not too</Content><Content>long an allowance for all she was expected to do in her room. But Rona's</Content><Content>manner was inviting. She wanted to see what the fun was. The temptress</Content><Content>held the door open, and beckoned beguilingly.</Content><Content>"All serene!" yielded Ulyth.</Content><Content>Rona seized her by the arm and dragged her delightedly down the passage.</Content><Content>"Now you're chummy," she murmured. "Whatever you do, though, don't make</Content><Content>a noise and give the show away!"</Content><Content>Still in the dark as to the Cuckoo's intentions, Ulyth allowed herself</Content><Content>to be led to Dormitory 2, No. 4, at the opposite side of the house. We</Content><Content>have mentioned before that the bedrooms at The Woodlands were very</Content><Content>spacious--so large, indeed, that each was partitioned into four cubicles</Content><Content>divided by lath-and-plaster walls. A passage inside the dormitory gave</Content><Content>access to the cubicles, which were in fact separate little bedrooms,</Content><Content>except that the partition walls, for purposes of ventilation, did not</Content><Content>reach the ceiling. At present the fourth cubicle in Dormitory 2 was</Content><Content>unoccupied, but its furniture was rather curiously arranged. One of the</Content><Content>beds had been pulled close against the partition, and a chest of</Content><Content>drawers, with the drawers removed, had been placed upon it.</Content><Content>"I fixed it up last night, and it was a job," whispered the Cuckoo.</Content><Content>"Good thing I'm strong. Now we've got to climb on that, and you'll see</Content><Content>what you'll see!"</Content><Content>Ulyth had an uneasy consciousness that she ought not to be mixed up in</Content><Content>such a business; but, after all, the girls often scrambled up and peeped</Content><Content>into one another's cubicles for a joke, so her action would not be</Content><Content>without precedent. She was a very human person, and liked fun as well as</Content><Content>anybody. With extreme caution she and Rona mounted the chest of drawers,</Content><Content>trying not to make the slightest noise. Their eyes were just on a level</Content><Content>with the top of the partition, and they had a good view of the next</Content><Content>cubicle. The occupants, Stephanie and her room-mate, Beth Broadway, were</Content><Content>far too absorbed to think of looking up towards the ceiling. Their</Content><Content>attention was concentrated on the parcel which had arrived by the post.</Content><Content>It contained a small bottle, carefully packed in shavings, and also a</Content><Content>typewritten letter, the purport of which seemed to electrify Stephanie.</Content><Content>"It's the most extraordinary thing I've ever heard!" she was saying.</Content><Content>"Beth, just listen to this."</Content><Content>And she read aloud:</Content><Content>            "66 HOLBORN VIADUCT,</Content><Content>                 LONDON.</Content><Content>"DEAR MADAM,</Content><Content>"Having seen your portrait, as a noted beauty, published in _The</Content><Content>Princess_, _The Ladies' Court Journal_, and other leading pictorials,</Content><Content>we venture to submit to you a sample of our famous Eau de Venus, an</Content><Content>invaluable adjunct to the toilet of any lady possessing a delicate</Content><Content>complexion. It is a perfectly harmless, fragrantly scented fluid, which,</Content><Content>if applied daily after breakfast, produces a rose-leaf bloom which is</Content><Content>absolutely incomparable. As it is a new preparation, we are anxious to</Content><Content>submit it to a few ladies of influence in the fashionable world, feeling</Content><Content>sure that, once used, they will recommend it.</Content><Content>"We shall esteem it a great favour if you will graciously try the</Content><Content>enclosed sample. We do not ask for testimonials, but any expression of</Content><Content>appreciation from one who figured so admirably as Queen of the Roses at</Content><Content>the Barrfield Pageant would be to us a source of immense gratification.</Content><Content>"May we recommend that the preparation be applied immediately after</Content><Content>breakfast, as its ingredients are more potent to the delicate pores of</Content><Content>the skin if used at that period of the morning.</Content><Content>"With apologies for troubling you, and hoping you will condescend to</Content><Content>give our Eau de Venus at least a trial,</Content><Content>    "We remain,</Content><Content>      "Faithfully yours,</Content><Content>        "RENAN, MARIETTE, ET CIE,</Content><Content>           Parfumeurs."</Content><Content>"How very peculiar!" gasped Beth, much impressed.</Content><Content>"It must be because they saw my photo in the papers," said Stephanie.</Content><Content>She was trying to speak casually, and not to appear too flattered, but</Content><Content>her eyes shone. "I believe that pageant made rather a sensation, and of</Content><Content>course, well, I was the principal figure in it. I suppose I shall have</Content><Content>to try this Eau de Venus."</Content><Content>"It's in a funny little bottle," commented Beth.</Content><Content>"Samples generally are. They never send you very much of a thing. They</Content><Content>want you to buy a big bottle afterwards."</Content><Content>Stephanie carefully removed the cork. The preparation seemed to be of a</Content><Content>pink, milky description.</Content><Content>"It smells of violets," she said, offering the bottle for Beth to sniff.</Content><Content>"I should certainly try it, if I were you," recommended the latter.</Content><Content>"It says it's quite harmless," continued Stephanie, referring to the</Content><Content>letter, "and should be used immediately after breakfast. Well, there's</Content><Content>no time like the present!"</Content><Content>If there was a curious agitation on the other side of the partition,</Content><Content>neither girl noticed it. Stephanie poured some of the liquid into her</Content><Content>hand and rubbed it over her face. Then she turned to the looking-glass.</Content><Content>"It seems very pink and queer! It's all in red streaks!"</Content><Content>"Perhaps you've put on too much. Wipe some of it off," advised Beth.</Content><Content>Vigorous measures with a sponge followed, and Stephanie anxiously</Content><Content>surveyed the result.</Content><Content>"It won't come off!" she faltered. "Oh, what have I done to myself? I'm</Content><Content>all red smears!"</Content><Content>Her dismay was too much for one at least on the other side of the</Content><Content>partition. Rona broke into a loud, cackling laugh. One swift glance</Content><Content>upwards and Stephanie realized that she was the victim of a practical</Content><Content>joke. It took her exactly three seconds to reach the next cubicle.</Content><Content>"So it's you, is it?" she exploded. "Well, Ulyth Stanton, I am</Content><Content>astonished! Evil communications corrupt good manners, and yours smack of</Content><Content>the backwoods."</Content><Content>"Don't throw it on Ulyth; she knew nothing about it," retorted the</Content><Content>chuckling Cuckoo belligerently. "It's my business, and I don't mind</Content><Content>telling you so!"</Content><Content>"I might have known, you--you utter cad! You don't deserve to be in a</Content><Content>school among ladies!"</Content><Content>"Go on. Pitch it as strong as you like. The cub's quits with you now for</Content><Content>all your airs and your nastiness."</Content><Content>"Oh, don't!" protested Ulyth, interfering in much distress. "Rona, do</Content><Content>stop! I'd no idea you meant to play such a dreadful trick on Stephie."</Content><Content>"You must have known something of it, or you wouldn't have come to look</Content><Content>on. I expect you were at the bottom of it," sneered Stephanie; "so don't</Content><Content>try to sneak out of it, Ulyth Stanton. Your precious joke has marked me</Content><Content>for life."</Content><Content>"No, no! It's only cochineal and milk. I got it from the cook," put in</Content><Content>the Cuckoo.</Content><Content>"It's stained her face all over, though," said Beth Broadway</Content><Content>reproachfully.</Content><Content>"I shall go straight to Miss Bowes," whimpered Stephanie.</Content><Content>"I wouldn't do that if I were you," said Ulyth. "Try some methylated</Content><Content>spirit first. I'll give you some from my room."</Content><Content>The remedy proved efficacious. The stains yielded to gentle rubbing, and</Content><Content>the four girls flew in a wild hurry to make their beds, three much</Content><Content>relieved and one naughtily exultant.</Content><Content>"I've paid out Stephie," panted Rona, tucking in her blankets anyhow. "I</Content><Content>felt proud of that letter. Made it up with the help of advertisements in</Content><Content>the _Illustrated Journal_. Then I typed it in the study while Teddie was</Content><Content>out. You didn't know I could type? Learnt how on the voyage, from a girl</Content><Content>who'd a typewriter on board with her. I laid on the butter pretty thick.</Content><Content>I knew Steph would swallow it to any amount. Oh, didn't she just look</Content><Content>flattered? It was prime! The under-housemaid posted the parcel for me."</Content><Content>"Stephie'll never forgive you!"</Content><Content>"Much I care!"</Content><Content>CHAPTER VII</Content><Content>The Cuckoo's Progress</Content><Content>"Your bear cub still needs taming, Ulyth," said Gertrude Oliver. "She</Content><Content>spilt her coffee this morning--such a mess on the tablecloth! I wish I</Content><Content>didn't sit next to her. I felt like Alice at the March Hare's</Content><Content>tea-party."</Content><Content>"It was half Maud's fault; she jerked her elbow," pleaded Ulyth in</Content><Content>extenuation.</Content><Content>"Oh, you can't whitewash her, so don't try! I won't say she isn't better</Content><Content>than when she arrived, but there's room for improvement."</Content><Content>"She's much slimmer. I suppose it must have been the voyage that had</Content><Content>made her grow so fat in September."</Content><Content>"I wish, at any rate, you could get her out of using those dreadful</Content><Content>backwoods expressions. It's high time she dropped them. She's been here</Content><Content>nearly a full term."</Content><Content>Ulyth thought so too, and the next time she found a suitable opportunity</Content><Content>she tackled Rona on the subject.</Content><Content>"You're too nice to speak in such a queer way. You've no idea how it</Content><Content>spoils you," she urged. "You could be another girl if you'd only take a</Content><Content>little trouble."</Content><Content>"What's the use? Who minds what I'm like?" returned the Cuckoo a trifle</Content><Content>defiantly.</Content><Content>"I do," said Ulyth emphatically.</Content><Content>"Not really?"</Content><Content>"Indeed I do. I care very much. You came over here to be my friend, and</Content><Content>there are many things I want in a friend."</Content><Content>"I didn't know you cared," replied Rona in a softened voice. "No one</Content><Content>ever did before--except Dad, when he said I was a savage."</Content><Content>"Don't you want to show him what you can grow into?" asked Ulyth</Content><Content>eagerly. "Think how surprised and pleased he'll be when he sees you</Content><Content>again!"</Content><Content>"There's something in that."</Content><Content>"There's a great deal in it. I know I often make myself do things I</Content><Content>don't want because of Mother; she's such a darling, and----" She stopped</Content><Content>short, realizing too late the mistake she was making.</Content><Content>"I can't remember Mother," answered Rona, turning away with a suggestive</Content><Content>cough. "It's all very well for you."</Content><Content>Ulyth could have bitten her tongue out. She said no more, for she knew</Content><Content>her room-mate well enough by this time to have learnt that sympathy must</Content><Content>be offered with the utmost discretion. The poor Cuckoo was only too well</Content><Content>aware of the deficiencies in her home and upbringing, but the least hint</Content><Content>of them from others immediately put her on the defensive. In her own way</Content><Content>she was very proud, and though there was a vast difference between</Content><Content>Stephanie's stinging remarks and Ulyth's well-meant kindness, anything</Content><Content>that savoured of compassion wounded her dignity.</Content><Content>The conversation brought urgently to Ulyth a question which had been</Content><Content>disturbing her, and which she had persistently tried to banish from her</Content><Content>thoughts. Where was Rona going to spend Christmas? So far as anyone knew</Content><Content>she had not a friend or relation in the British Isles. Miss Bowes and</Content><Content>Miss Teddington always went away for the holidays, and The Woodlands was</Content><Content>left in the charge of servants. Rona could not stay at the school,</Content><Content>surely? Had Miss Bowes made any arrangement for her? Ulyth vacillated</Content><Content>for at least five minutes, then took out her writing-case and began a</Content><Content>letter home.</Content><Content>"BEST-BELOVED MOTHERKINS,</Content><Content>"I am such a nasty, horrid, selfish thing! In every one of your letters</Content><Content>you have hinted and hinted and hinted that we should ask Rona for</Content><Content>Christmas. You wouldn't say it outright until you were sure I wanted it.</Content><Content>That was just the rub. I didn't want it. I'm afraid even now I don't</Content><Content>quite. I've had her all the term, and I thought it would be so blissful</Content><Content>to be without her for four whole weeks, and have you and Father and</Content><Content>Oswald and Dorothy and Peter just to myself. But oh, Motherkins, she's</Content><Content>such a lonely waif of a girl! I'm so dreadfully sorry for her. She seems</Content><Content>always out of everything. I'm sure she's never had a decent Christmas in</Content><Content>her life. I believe she's fond of her father, though I don't think he</Content><Content>took very much notice of her--she let out once that he was so</Content><Content>disappointed she wasn't a boy. But Mrs. Barker, the housekeeper, must</Content><Content>have been a most terrible person. Rona had no chance at all.</Content><Content>"Motherkins, she's never seen a real English home, and I'd like to show</Content><Content>her ours. Yes, I would, although in a way she'll spoil everything. May</Content><Content>she sleep in the spare room, and let me have my own to myself? I could</Content><Content>stand it then.</Content><Content>"Dearest darling, I really mean it; so will you write straight off to</Content><Content>Miss Bowes before I have time to turn thoroughly horrid again?</Content><Content>    "Your very loving daughter,</Content><Content>          "ULYTH."</Content><Content>Having sent off the letter, and thus burnt her boats, Ulyth accepted the</Content><Content>situation with what equanimity she could muster. Mrs. Stanton's</Content><Content>invitation arrived by return of post, and was accepted with great relief</Content><Content>by Miss Bowes, who had been wondering how to dispose of her pupil during</Content><Content>the holidays. The Cuckoo received the news with such pathetic glee that</Content><Content>Ulyth's heart smote her for not feeling more joyful herself.</Content><Content>"Are you sure you want me?" asked Rona wistfully.</Content><Content>"Of course we do, or we wouldn't ask you," replied Ulyth, hoping her fib</Content><Content>might be forgiven.</Content><Content>"I'll try and not disgrace you," volunteered the Cuckoo.</Content><Content>A few days before the end of the term Rona received a letter from New</Content><Content>Zealand. She rushed to Ulyth, waving it triumphantly.</Content><Content>"Dad's sent me this," she announced, showing a very handsome cheque. "I</Content><Content>wrote to him three days after I got here, and told him my clothes looked</Content><Content>rubbishy beside the other girls', and he tells me to rig myself out</Content><Content>afresh. I suppose he forgot about it till now. How'm I going to get the</Content><Content>things? There isn't time to ask Miss Bowes to send for them before the</Content><Content>holidays. Can I buy them at the place where you live?"</Content><Content>"Very well indeed, and Mother will help you to choose. I know she'll get</Content><Content>you lovely clothes; she has such exquisite taste! She'll just enjoy it."</Content><Content>"And shan't I just? I'll give away every rag I brought with me from New</Content><Content>Zealand. They'll come in for that rummage sale Teddie was telling us</Content><Content>about."</Content><Content>The last lesson was finished, the last exercise written, even the last</Content><Content>breakfast had been disposed of. The boxes, packed with great excitement</Content><Content>the day before, were already dispatched, and four railway omnibuses were</Content><Content>waiting to take the girls to Llangarmon Junction Station. Much to their</Content><Content>regret, Miss Bowes would not allow them to go by Glanafon--the</Content><Content>picturesque route by the ferry was reserved for summer weather. In</Content><Content>winter, if the day happened to be stormy and the tide full, there was</Content><Content>often great difficulty in crossing, the landing-place was muddy and</Content><Content>slippery, and even if the train was not missed altogether (as sometimes</Content><Content>happened) the small voyage was quite in the nature of an adventure.</Content><Content>Miss Bowes' wisdom was thoroughly justified on this particular morning,</Content><Content>for there was a strong west wind, and the rain was pouring in torrents.</Content><Content>"It would have been lovely fun in the flat. There must be big waves on</Content><Content>the river," declared Merle Denham, half aggrieved at missing such an</Content><Content>interesting opportunity.</Content><Content>"Why, but look at the rain! You couldn't hold up an umbrella for half a</Content><Content>second. It would be blown inside out directly. You'd be as drenched as a</Content><Content>drowned rat before you reached the train," preached her more prudent</Content><Content>sister.</Content><Content>"And suppose you were blown off the stepping-stones into the river!"</Content><Content>added Beth Broadway. "It would be a nice way of beginning the holidays!</Content><Content>No. On a morning like this I'd rather have the omnibus. We shall at</Content><Content>least start dry."</Content><Content>"I'm so glad you're taking Rona home with you," whispered Lizzie</Content><Content>Lonsdale to Ulyth. "I should have asked her myself if you hadn't. It</Content><Content>would have been a wretched Christmas for her to be left at school. I</Content><Content>never saw anyone so pleased!"</Content><Content>The Cuckoo was indeed looking radiant at the golden prospect in store</Content><Content>for her. Much to her surprise, everybody had been particularly nice to</Content><Content>her that morning. Several girls had given her their addresses and asked</Content><Content>her to write to them, Miss Bowes had been kindness itself, and even Miss</Content><Content>Teddington, whose conduct was generally of a Spartan order, when bidding</Content><Content>her good-bye in the study, had actually bestowed an abrupt peck of a</Content><Content>kiss, a mark of favour never before known in the annals of the school.</Content><Content>To be sure, she had followed it with a warning against relapsing into</Content><Content>loud laughter in other people's houses; but then she was Miss</Content><Content>Teddington!</Content><Content>Ulyth lived in Staffordshire, and the journey from North Wales was</Content><Content>tedious; but what schoolgirl minds a long journey? To Rona all was new</Content><Content>and delightful, and to Ulyth every telegraph-post meant that she was so</Content><Content>much nearer home. The travellers had a royal reception, and kind,</Content><Content>tactful Mrs. Stanton managed at once to put her young guest at ease, and</Content><Content>make her feel that she was a welcome addition to the family circle.</Content><Content>Oswald, Ulyth's elder brother, had come from Harrow only an hour before,</Content><Content>and Dorothy and Peter, the two younger children, were prancing about in</Content><Content>utmost enthusiasm at the exciting arrivals.</Content><Content>"Father hasn't come in yet?" asked Ulyth, when she had finished hugging</Content><Content>her mother. "Well, it will be all the bigger treat when he does. Oh,</Content><Content>Oswald, I didn't think you could grow so much in a term! Dorothy,</Content><Content>darling, don't quite choke me! Peterkin, come and shake hands with Rona.</Content><Content>Toby, do stop barking for half a moment! Where's Tabbyskins? And,</Content><Content>please, show me the new parrot. Oh, isn't it lovely to be at home</Content><Content>again!"</Content><Content>Almost the whole of the next day was spent by Mrs. Stanton, Ulyth, and</Content><Content>their delighted visitor in a tour round various outfitting</Content><Content>establishments--an exhilarating time for Rona, who was making her first</Content><Content>acquaintance with the glories of English shops. Their purchases were</Content><Content>highly satisfactory, and as Ulyth helped her friend to dress for dinner</Content><Content>on Christmas Day she reviewed the result with the utmost complacency.</Content><Content>"Didn't I tell you Mother has good taste? Rona, you're lovely! This</Content><Content>pale-blue dress suits you to a T. And the bronze slippers are so dainty;</Content><Content>and your hair is so pretty. You can't think how it has improved lately."</Content><Content>"Do I look like other girls?" asked Rona, fingering the enamelled locket</Content><Content>that had been given her that morning by Mr. and Mrs. Stanton.</Content><Content>"Rather! A great deal nicer than most. I'm proud of you. I wish they</Content><Content>could all see you at The Woodlands."</Content><Content>"I'm glad if I shan't disgrace you. What a good thing Dad's cheque came</Content><Content>just in time!"</Content><Content>In her new plumage the Cuckoo appeared turned into a tropical</Content><Content>humming-bird. Ulyth had thought her good-looking before, but she had not</Content><Content>realized that her room-mate was a beauty. She stared almost fascinated</Content><Content>at the vision of blue eyes, coral cheeks, white neck, and ruddy-brown</Content><Content>hair. Was this indeed the same girl who had arrived at school last</Content><Content>September? It was like a transformation scene in the pantomime. Clothes</Content><Content>undoubtedly exercise a great effect on some people, and Rona seemed to</Content><Content>put away her backwoods manners with her up-country dresses. There was a</Content><Content>dignity about her now and a desire to please which she had never shown</Content><Content>at The Woodlands. She held herself straight, walked gracefully instead</Content><Content>of shambling, and was careful to allow no uncouth expressions to escape</Content><Content>her. Her behaviour was very quiet, as if she were watching others, or</Content><Content>taking mental stock of how to comport herself. If occasionally she made</Content><Content>some slight mistake she flushed crimson, but she never repeated it. She</Content><Content>was learning the whole time, and the least gentle hint from Mrs. Stanton</Content><Content>was sufficient for her. Miss Teddington need not have been afraid that</Content><Content>the loud laugh would offend the ears of her friends; it never rang out</Content><Content>once, and the high-pitched voice was subdued to wonderfully softened</Content><Content>tones. For her hostess Rona evinced a species of worship. She would</Content><Content>follow her about the house, content simply to be near her, and her face</Content><Content>would light up at the slightest word addressed to her.</Content><Content>"The poor child just wanted a good mothering," said Mrs. Stanton to</Content><Content>Ulyth. "It is marvellous how fast she is improving. You'll make</Content><Content>something of your little wild bird after all. She's worth the trouble."</Content><Content>"I'd no idea she could grow into this," replied Ulyth. "Oh, Motherkins,</Content><Content>you should have seen her at first! She was a very rough diamond."</Content><Content>"Aren't you glad to have a hand in the polishing? It will be such a</Content><Content>triumph."</Content><Content>Two members of the household, at any rate, saw no fault in the visitor.</Content><Content>Dorothy and Peter haunted her like small persistent ghosts, begging for</Content><Content>stories about New Zealand. The accounts of her life in the bush were</Content><Content>like a romance to them, and so fired their enthusiasm that in the</Content><Content>intervals of playing soldiers they tried to emulate her adventures, and</Content><Content>were found with a clothes-line in the garden making a wild attempt to</Content><Content>lasso the much-enduring Toby.</Content><Content>"Rona's very good-natured with them," said Ulyth. "She doesn't mind how</Content><Content>they pull her about, and Peter's most exhausting sometimes. I shouldn't</Content><Content>like to carry him round the house on my back. Dorothy's perfectly</Content><Content>insatiable for stories; it's always 'Tell us another!' How funny Oswald</Content><Content>is at present. He's grown so outrageously polite all of a sudden. I</Content><Content>suppose it's because he's in the Sixth now. He was very different last</Content><Content>holidays. He's getting quite a 'lady's man'."</Content><Content>"The young folks are growing up very fast," commented Mr. Stanton in</Content><Content>private. "It seems only yesterday that Oswald and Ulyth were babies. In</Content><Content>another year or two we shall begin to think of twenty-first-birthday</Content><Content>dances."</Content><Content>"Oh, don't talk of anything so dreadful!" said Mrs. Stanton in</Content><Content>consternation. "They're my babies still. The party on Thursday is to be</Content><Content>quite a children's affair."</Content><Content>Though "Motherkins" might regard the coming festivity as entirely of a</Content><Content>juvenile character, the young people took it seriously. They practised</Content><Content>dancing on the polished linoleum of the nursery every evening. Rona had</Content><Content>had her first lessons at The Woodlands, and was making heroic efforts to</Content><Content>remember what she had learnt.</Content><Content>"You'll get on all right," Ulyth encouraged her. "That last was ever so</Content><Content>much better; you're dropping into it quite nicely. You dance lightly,</Content><Content>at any rate. Now try again with Oswald while I play. Ossie, I'm proud of</Content><Content>you! Last Christmas you were a perfect duffer at it. Don't you remember</Content><Content>how you sat out at the Warings'? You've improved immensely. Now go on!"</Content><Content>and Ulyth began to play, with her eyes alternately on the piano and on</Content><Content>the partners.</Content><Content>"I suppose a fellow has to get used to 'the light fantastic' sometime,"</Content><Content>remarked Oswald, as, after a successful five minutes' practice, he and</Content><Content>Rona sat down to rest.</Content><Content>"Perhaps you'll have to dance with princesses at foreign Courts when</Content><Content>you're a successful ambassador," laughed Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Is that what Oswald's going to be?" asked Rona.</Content><Content>"I'd have tried the Army or the Navy, but my wretched eyes cut me off</Content><Content>from both; so it's no use, worse luck!" said Oswald. "I should like to</Content><Content>get into the Diplomatic Service immensely though, if I could."</Content><Content>"Why can't you? I should think you could do anything you really wanted."</Content><Content>"Thanks for the compliment. But it's not so easy as it sounds. I wish I</Content><Content>had a friend at Court."</Content><Content>"We don't know anybody in the Government," sighed Ulyth. "Not a</Content><Content>solitary, single person. I've never even seen a member of Parliament,</Content><Content>except, of course, Lord Glyncraig sometimes at church; but then I've</Content><Content>never spoken to him. Stephanie had tea with him once. She doesn't let us</Content><Content>forget that."</Content><Content>"I wish you'd had tea with him, and happened to mention particularly the</Content><Content>extreme fascinations and abilities of your elder brother," laughed</Content><Content>Oswald.</Content><Content>"Could Lord Glyncraig be of any use to you?" asked Rona. She had grown</Content><Content>suddenly thoughtful.</Content><Content>"He could give me a nomination for the Diplomatic Service, and that</Content><Content>would be just the leg-up I want. But it's no use joking; I'm not likely</Content><Content>to get an introduction to him. I expect I shall have to go into business</Content><Content>after all."</Content><Content>"I think when I was ten I must have been the most objectionable little</Content><Content>imp on the face of creation," said Rona slowly. "I am ashamed of myself</Content><Content>now."</Content><Content>"Why this access of penitence for bygone crimes?"</Content><Content>"Oh, nothing!" replied the Cuckoo, flushing. "I was only just thinking</Content><Content>of something. Shall we try that new step again? I'm rested now."</Content><Content>"Yours to command, madam!" returned Oswald, with a mock bow.</Content><Content>       *       *       *       *       *</Content><Content>Rona's visit to the Stantons was a delightful series of new impressions.</Content><Content>She made her first acquaintance with the pantomime, and was alternately</Content><Content>amused and thrilled as the story of "The Forty Thieves" unfolded itself</Content><Content>upon the stage. Not even Peter watched with more round-eyed enthusiasm,</Content><Content>and Mr. Stanton declared it was worth taking her for the mere pleasure</Content><Content>of seeing her face when Ali Baba disappeared down a trap-door. As</Content><Content>everything in England was fresh to her, she was a most easy guest to</Content><Content>entertain, and she enjoyed every separate experience--from a visit to</Content><Content>the public library with Mr. Stanton to toffee-making in the nursery with</Content><Content>Peter and Dorothy.</Content><Content>Although it was a quiet Christmas in some respects, friends were</Content><Content>hospitable, and included her in the various little invitations which</Content><Content>were sent to Ulyth and Oswald; so her pretty dresses had a chance of</Content><Content>being aired. The great event to the young folk was the party which was</Content><Content>to be given at the Stantons' own house, and which was to be a kind of</Content><Content>finish to the holidays. The girls revelled in every detail of</Content><Content>preparation. They watched the carpet being taken up in the drawing-room,</Content><Content>the large articles of furniture removed, and the door taken off its</Content><Content>hinges. They sprinkled ball-room chalk on the boards of the floor, and</Content><Content>slid indefatigably until the polish satisfied Ulyth's critical taste.</Content><Content>They decorated the walls with flags and evergreens. They even offered</Content><Content>their services in the kitchen, but met with so cool a reception from the</Content><Content>busy cook that they did not venture to repeat the experiment, and</Content><Content>consoled themselves with helping to write the supper menus instead.</Content><Content>"I think I've seen to everything," said Mrs. Stanton distractedly. "The</Content><Content>flowers, and the fairy lamps, and the programmes, and those extra boxes</Content><Content>of crackers, and the chocolates, and the ring for the trifle. You've</Content><Content>seen about the music, Gerald?"</Content><Content>"Violin and piano," replied Mr. Stanton. "I'm feeling a thorough-going</Content><Content>martyr. Giving even a simple children's hop means sitting in rooms</Content><Content>without doors and living on turkey drumsticks for a fortnight</Content><Content>afterwards!"</Content><Content>"Oh, we'll get the house straight again sooner than that! And you</Content><Content>needn't eat grilled turkey unless you like."</Content><Content>"I don't appreciate parties."</Content><Content>"We must amuse the young folks, and it isn't a grand affair. If the</Content><Content>children meet together they may as well dance as play games."</Content><Content>"Daddikins, how nasty you are!" exclaimed Ulyth, pursuing him to</Content><Content>administer chastisement in the shape of smacking kisses. "You know</Content><Content>you're looking forward to it quite as much as we are."</Content><Content>"That I deny _in toto_," groaned her father as he escaped to his</Content><Content>snuggery, only to find it arranged as a dressing-room.</Content><Content>Ulyth wore white for the great occasion, with her best Venetian beads;</Content><Content>and Rona had a palest sea-green gauzy voile, with fine stockings and</Content><Content>satin shoes to match. Dorothy was a bewitching little vision in pink,</Content><Content>and Peter a cherub in black velvet. Oswald, having reached the stage of</Content><Content>real gentleman's evening-dress, required the whole family to assist him</Content><Content>in the due arrangement of his tie, over which he was more than usually</Content><Content>particular. Ulyth even suspected him of having tried to shave, though he</Content><Content>denied the accusation fiercely.</Content><Content>It is always a solemn occasion waiting in the drawing-room listening for</Content><Content>the first peal of the bell announcing visitors. Mrs. Stanton was giving</Content><Content>a last touch to the flowers, Ulyth sat wielding her new fan (a Christmas</Content><Content>present), Oswald was buttoning his gloves. Dorothy, too excited to</Content><Content>stand still for a moment, flitted about like a pink fairy.</Content><Content>"I'm to stop up half an hour later than Peter, Rona; do you hear that?"</Content><Content>she chattered. "Oh, I do hope the Prestons will arrive first of anybody!</Content><Content>I want to dance with Willie. Father let me have a cracker just now, and</Content><Content>it's got a whistle inside it. I wish I had a pocket. Where shall I put</Content><Content>it to keep it safe? Oh, I know--inside that vase!"</Content><Content>As she spoke, Dorothy jumped lightly on to the seat of the cosy corner</Content><Content>that abutted on the fireplace, and reached upwards to drop her whistle</Content><Content>inside the ornament. In her excitement she slipped, tried to save</Content><Content>herself, lost her footing, and fell sideways over the curb on to the</Content><Content>hearth. Her thin, flimsy dress was within half an inch of the fire, but</Content><Content>at that instant Rona, who was standing by, clutched her and pulled her</Content><Content>forwards. It all happened in three seconds. She was safe before her</Content><Content>father had time to run across the room. The family stared aghast.</Content><Content>"Whew! That was a near shave!" gasped Oswald.</Content><Content>Dorothy, too much surprised and frightened to cry, was clinging to her</Content><Content>mother. Mr. Stanton, acting on the spur of the moment, rushed to the</Content><Content>telephone to try if any ironmonger's shop in the town was still open,</Content><Content>and could immediately send up a wire-gauze fire-protector. The</Content><Content>fireplaces in all the other rooms were well guarded, but in the</Content><Content>drawing-room the hearth was so wide, and the curb so high, that the</Content><Content>precaution had not been considered necessary.</Content><Content>"It only shows how absolutely vital it is to leave no chance of an</Content><Content>accident," said Mr. Stanton, returning from the telephone. "Matthews are</Content><Content>sending a boy up at once with a guard. If it hadn't been for Rona's</Content><Content>promptitude---- Oh, there's the bell! Oswald, fetch your mother a glass</Content><Content>of water."</Content><Content>Poor Mrs. Stanton looked very pale, but had recovered her composure</Content><Content>sufficiently to receive her young guests by the time they were ushered</Content><Content>into the drawing-room. Dorothy, child-like, forgot her fright in the</Content><Content>pleasure of welcoming her friends the Prestons, and everything went on</Content><Content>as if the accident had not occurred. Mr. Stanton, indeed, kept a close</Content><Content>watch all the evening, to see that guards were not pushed aside from the</Content><Content>fires, and Mrs. Stanton's eyes watched with more than usual solicitude a</Content><Content>certain little pink figure as it went dancing round the room. The</Content><Content>visitors knew nothing of the accident that had been avoided, and there</Content><Content>was no check on the mirth of the party. The guests were of all ages,</Content><Content>from Peter's kindergarten comrades to girls who were nearly grown-up,</Content><Content>but it was really all the jollier for the mixture. Tall and short danced</Content><Content>together with a happy disregard of inches, and even a thorough enjoyment</Content><Content>of the disparity. Rona spent a royal evening. Her host and hostess had</Content><Content>been kindness itself before, but to-night it seemed as if they conspired</Content><Content>together to give her the best of everything. She had her pick of</Content><Content>partners, the place of honour at supper, and--by most egregious</Content><Content>cheating--the ring somehow tumbled on to her plate out of the trifle.</Content><Content>"I'm getting spoilt," she said to Oswald.</Content><Content>"The mater's ready to kiss your boots," he returned. "I never saw</Content><Content>anything so quick as the way you snatched old Dolly."</Content><Content>All good things come to an end some time, even holidays, and one morning</Content><Content>towards the end of January witnessed a taxi at the door, and various</Content><Content>bags and packages, labelled Llangarmon Junction, stowed inside.</Content><Content>"I don't know how to thank you. I haven't any words," gulped Rona, as</Content><Content>she hugged "Motherkins" good-bye.</Content><Content>"Do your best at school, and remember certain little things we talked</Content><Content>about," whispered Mrs. Stanton, kissing her. "We shall expect to see you</Content><Content>here again."</Content><Content>CHAPTER VIII</Content><Content>The "Stunt"</Content><Content>The general verdict on Rona, when she arrived back at The Woodlands, was</Content><Content>that she was wonderfully improved.</Content><Content>"It isn't only her dresses," said Gertrude Oliver, "though she looks a</Content><Content>different girl in her new clothes; her whole style's altered. She used</Content><Content>to be so fearfully loud. She's really toned down in the most amazing</Content><Content>fashion. I couldn't have believed it possible."</Content><Content>"I'm afraid it's only a veneer," declared Stephanie, with a slighting</Content><Content>little laugh. "You'll find plenty of raw backwoods underneath, ready to</Content><Content>crop up when she's off her guard. You should have heard her this</Content><Content>morning."</Content><Content>"And she broke an ink-bottle," added Beth Broadway.</Content><Content>"Well, she's not perfect yet, of course, but I stick to it that she's</Content><Content>improved."</Content><Content>"Oh, I dare say! But Ulyth's welcome to keep her cub. She'll always be</Content><Content>more or less of a trial. What else can you expect? 'What's bred in the</Content><Content>bone will come out!'"</Content><Content>"Yes, I'm a great believer in heredity," urged Beth, taking up the</Content><Content>cudgels for her chum. "If you have ancestors it gives you a decided</Content><Content>pull."</Content><Content>"Everybody has ancestors, you goose," corrected Gertrude.</Content><Content>"Well, of course I mean aristocratic ones. The others don't count. It</Content><Content>must make a difference whether your grandfather was a gentleman or a</Content><Content>farm-boy. Rona says herself she's a democrat. I'm sure she looked the</Content><Content>part when she arrived."</Content><Content>"I don't know that she exactly looks it now, though," said Gertrude,</Content><Content>championing Rona for once.</Content><Content>Everyone at the school realized that the Cuckoo was trying to behave</Content><Content>herself. The struggles towards perfection were sometimes almost</Content><Content>pathetic, though the girls mostly viewed them from the humorous side.</Content><Content>She would sit up suddenly, bolt upright, at the tea table, if Miss</Content><Content>Bowes' eye suggested that she was lolling; she apologized for accidents</Content><Content>at which she had laughed before, and she corrected herself if a</Content><Content>backwoods expression escaped her.</Content><Content>"Am I really any shakes smarter--I mean, more toned up--than I was?" she</Content><Content>asked Ulyth anxiously.</Content><Content>"You're far better than you were last term. Do go on trying, that's</Content><Content>all!"</Content><Content>"Will they take me as a candidate in the Camp-fire League?"</Content><Content>"I expect so, but we shall have to ask Mrs. Arnold about that."</Content><Content>Since the great reunion by the stream in September there had been no</Content><Content>meetings of the Camp-fire League. Mrs. Arnold had been ill, and then</Content><Content>had gone away to recruit her health, and no one was able to take her</Content><Content>place as "Guardian of the Fire". She was recovered now, and at home</Content><Content>again, and had promised to help to make up for lost time by</Content><Content>superintending a gathering at the beginning of the new term. It was to</Content><Content>be held in the big hall of the school, though the girls begged hard to</Content><Content>have it out-of-doors, pleading that on a fine evening they could keep</Content><Content>perfectly warm, and it would only resemble a Fifth of November affair.</Content><Content>"That may be all very well for you, but I'm not going to risk Mrs.</Content><Content>Arnold's catching cold," returned Miss Bowes; which argument put a final</Content><Content>stop to the idea.</Content><Content>"We'll have ripping fun in the hall, if we can't be outside," beamed</Content><Content>Addie. "I always enjoy a stunt."</Content><Content>"What's a stunt?" asked Rona.</Content><Content>"A stunt? Why, it's just a stunt!"</Content><Content>"It's an American word," explained Lizzie. "It means just having any fun</Content><Content>that comes. An impromptu kind of thing, you know. We sing, or recite, or</Content><Content>act, or dance, on the spur of the moment--anything to keep the ball</Content><Content>rolling, and anybody may be called upon at any moment to stand up and</Content><Content>perform."</Content><Content>"Without knowing beforehand?" queried Rona, looking horror-stricken.</Content><Content>"Yes, that's the fun of it. We have a bag with all our names written on</Content><Content>slips of paper, and we draw them out one by one to fill up the</Content><Content>programme. Nobody knows who's to come next. You may be the very first,</Content><Content>or you may sit quaking all the evening, and never be called at all."</Content><Content>"I hope to goodness--I mean, I hope very much--I shan't be drawn."</Content><Content>"You never know; so you'd better have something in your mind's eye."</Content><Content>Punctually at six o'clock on the appointed night the whole school filed</Content><Content>into the hall, each girl carrying a candle in a candlestick. Saluting</Content><Content>their leader, they ranged themselves round the room for the opening</Content><Content>ceremony. At an indoor meeting this was of necessity different from the</Content><Content>kindling of the camp-fire, but it had a certain impressiveness of its</Content><Content>own. First the lamps were extinguished, and the room was placed in</Content><Content>entire darkness. Then Mrs. Arnold struck a match and lighted her candle,</Content><Content>which she held towards the Torch-bearer of highest rank, who lighted</Content><Content>hers from it, and performed the same service for her next neighbour. In</Content><Content>this way, one after another, the candles were lighted all round the</Content><Content>room, every girl saying, as she offered the flame to her comrade: "I</Content><Content>pass on my light!" After the "shining" song was sung, all the</Content><Content>candlesticks were arranged on the large central table, taking the place</Content><Content>the camp-fire would have occupied out-of-doors.</Content><Content>The business of the meeting came first, the roll-call was read, and the</Content><Content>recorders gave their reports of the last gathering. Several members were</Content><Content>awarded honours for knowing the stars, being able to observe certain</Content><Content>things in geology and field botany, or for ability in outdoor sports or</Content><Content>indoor occupations, such as carpentry, stencilling, or sewing. The</Content><Content>ambulance work and the knitting done last term were specially noted and</Content><Content>commended. A few new candidates applied for enrolment, and their</Content><Content>qualifications were carefully considered by the Guardian of the Fire.</Content><Content>Rona, after undergoing the League Catechism from Catherine Sullivan, the</Content><Content>head girl and chief Torch-bearer, had submitted her name as candidate,</Content><Content>and now waited with much anxiety to hear whether she would be accepted.</Content><Content>After several others had been admitted, Mrs. Arnold at last called:</Content><Content>"Corona Margarita Mitchell."</Content><Content>Quite startled at the unaccustomed sound of her full Christian name,</Content><Content>Rona saluted and stepped forward.</Content><Content>"You have passed only three out of the seven tests required," said Mrs.</Content><Content>Arnold. "I'm afraid you will have to try again, Rona, and see if you can</Content><Content>be more successful before the next meeting. No candidate can be accepted</Content><Content>except on very good grounds. That is the law of the League."</Content><Content>Much crestfallen, the Cuckoo fell back into her place, and Mrs. Arnold</Content><Content>was just about to read the next name when Ulyth interrupted:</Content><Content>"Please, Guardian, if a candidate has shown unusual presence of mind,</Content><Content>may that not stand in place of some of the other tests?"</Content><Content>"It depends on the circumstances. How does that apply in this case?"</Content><Content>"Rona has saved a life," declared Ulyth, then explained briefly how</Content><Content>Dorothy had fallen on to the hearth and had been caught back from the</Content><Content>fire in the very nick of time.</Content><Content>"In her thin dress she would probably have been burnt to death but for</Content><Content>Rona's quickness," added Ulyth, with a tremble in her voice.</Content><Content>"I had not heard of this," replied Mrs. Arnold. "Rona is very greatly to</Content><Content>be congratulated on her presence of mind. Yes, I may safely say that it</Content><Content>can cancel the tests in which she has failed, and that we may enrol her</Content><Content>to-night as a candidate. Corona Margarita Mitchell, if for three months</Content><Content>you preserve a good character in the school, and learn to recite the</Content><Content>seven rules of the Camp-fire Law, you may then present yourself as</Content><Content>eligible for the initial rank of Wood-gatherer in the League. There is</Content><Content>your Candidate's Badge."</Content><Content>Immensely gratified, Rona received her little bow of blue ribbon. She</Content><Content>had hardly dared to hope for success, as Catherine had been rather</Content><Content>withering over her Catechism, and had warned her that she would probably</Content><Content>be disqualified. It was pleasant to meet with encouragement, and</Content><Content>especially to be commended before the whole school. She had never dreamt</Content><Content>of such luck, and she looked her grateful thanks at Ulyth across the</Content><Content>room.</Content><Content>She was the last but one on the list of applicants, and when Jessie</Content><Content>Howard (alas, poor Jessie!) had been rejected the ceremonial part of the</Content><Content>meeting was over. The girls smiled, for now the "stunt" was to begin.</Content><Content>Catherine produced the bag, shook it well, and handed it to Mrs. Arnold,</Content><Content>who drew out a slip of paper.</Content><Content>"Marjorie Earnshaw!" she announced.</Content><Content>"Glad it's one of the Sixth to open the ball," murmured some of the</Content><Content>younger girls as Marjorie stepped to the circle reserved for performers</Content><Content>in front of the table.</Content><Content>The owner of the one guitar in the school was always much in request at</Content><Content>Camp-fire gatherings, so it seemed a fortunate chance that her name</Content><Content>should be drawn first. She had brought her instrument, so as to be</Content><Content>prepared in case the lot fell on her, and giving the E string a last</Content><Content>hurried tuning she sat down and began a popular American ditty. It was a</Content><Content>favourite among the girls, for it had a lively, rollicking chorus, which</Content><Content>they sang with great gusto. Fifty voices roaring out: "Don't forget your</Content><Content>Dinah!" seemed to break the ice and set the fun going.</Content><Content>Marjorie's E string snapped suddenly, but she played as best she could</Content><Content>on the others, though she confessed afterwards that she felt like a</Content><Content>horse that has lost its shoe. Except for this accident she would have</Content><Content>responded to the enthusiastic calls of "Encore!"; as it was, she retired</Content><Content>into the background to fix a new string. It lent a decided element of</Content><Content>excitement to the programme that nobody knew what the next item was to</Content><Content>be. The lot, as it happened, fell on one of the younger girls, who was</Content><Content>overwhelmed with shyness and could only with great urging be persuaded</Content><Content>to recite a short piece of poetry. By the law of the Stunt everybody was</Content><Content>obliged to perform if called upon, so Aveline fired off her sixteen</Content><Content>lines of Longfellow with breathless speed, and fled back joyfully to the</Content><Content>ranks of the Juniors. Two piano solos and a step-dance followed, then</Content><Content>the turn came to Doris Deane, a member of the Upper Fifth. Doris's</Content><Content>speciality was acting, so she promptly begged for two assistants, and</Content><Content>chose from IV B a couple of junior members who had practised with her</Content><Content>before. Taking Nellie and Trissie for "Asia" and "Australia", she gave</Content><Content>the scene from _Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch_ where that delightful</Content><Content>but haphazard heroine gets herself and the children ready to go to the</Content><Content>opera. The zeal with which she ironed their dresses, her alternate</Content><Content>scoldings and cajolings, her wild hunt for the tickets, which all the</Content><Content>while were stuck in her belt, the grandeur of her deportment when the</Content><Content>family was at last prepared for the outing, all were most amusingly</Content><Content>represented. Doris was really a born actress, and so completely carried</Content><Content>her audience with her that the lack of costumes and scenery was not felt</Content><Content>in the force of the reality that she managed to throw into her part.</Content><Content>Covered with glory, she gave place to her successor, who, while</Content><Content>bewailing the hardness of her luck in having to follow so smart a</Content><Content>performance, recited a humorous ballad which won peals of applause. Mrs.</Content><Content>Arnold again dipped her hand into the bag and unfolded a twist of paper.</Content><Content>"Corona M. Mitchell," she read.</Content><Content>"Not me, surely! I can't do anything," objected Rona hastily.</Content><Content>"You'll have to," laughed the girls. "No one's let off."</Content><Content>"I can't, I tell you. I've no parlour tricks."</Content><Content>"Give us a story, Rona," suggested Ulyth. "One of those New Zealand</Content><Content>adventures you used to tell to Peter and Dorothy. They loved them."</Content><Content>"Yes, yes! A camp-fire story. That would be spiffing!" clamoured the</Content><Content>girls. "Sit on the floor, near the fire, and we'll all squat near you.</Content><Content>We haven't had a story for ages and ages!"</Content><Content>"Tell it just as you did at home," urged Ulyth.</Content><Content>"I'll try my best," sighed Rona, taking a small stool near the fire, so</Content><Content>as to be slightly above the audience clustered round the hearthrug.</Content><Content>"It happened about a year ago," she began; "that's summer-time in New</Content><Content>Zealand, you know, because the seasons are just opposite. It was Pamela</Content><Content>Higson's birthday, and I'd been asked to go over for the day. I saddled</Content><Content>Brownie, my best pony, and started at seven, because it's a twelve-mile</Content><Content>ride to the Higsons' farm, and I wanted to be early so as to have time</Content><Content>for plenty of fun. Brownie was fresh, and he wasn't tired when I got</Content><Content>there, so we decided to give him an hour's rest and then ride up into</Content><Content>the bush and have a picnic. Pamela showed me her birthday presents while</Content><Content>we waited. She'd had a box sent her by the mail, and she was very</Content><Content>delighted about it.</Content><Content>"Well, at perhaps eleven o'clock I set off with Pamela and the rest of</Content><Content>the Higson children. There was Jake, just my own age, and Billy, a</Content><Content>little younger, and Connie and Minnie, the two smallest. Oh yes, we each</Content><Content>had our own horse or pony: Everybody rides out there. We slung baskets</Content><Content>and tin cans over our saddles and then started up by the dry bed of the</Content><Content>river towards the head of the gully. It was very hot (January's like</Content><Content>July here), but we all had big hats and we didn't care. It was such fun</Content><Content>to be together. When your nearest neighbours are twelve miles off you</Content><Content>don't see them often enough to get tired of them. Billy was always</Content><Content>making jokes, and Jake was jolly too in a quiet kind of way. Sometimes</Content><Content>we could all ride abreast, and sometimes we had to go in single file,</Content><Content>and our horses seemed to enjoy it as much as we did. Brownie loved</Content><Content>company, so it was a treat for him as well as for me. The place we were</Content><Content>going to was a piece of high land that lay at the top of the valley</Content><Content>above the Higsons' block. There were generally plenty of berries up</Content><Content>there, and we thought they'd just be ripe. It took us a fairly long time</Content><Content>to do the climb, because there was no proper road, only a rough track.</Content><Content>It was lovely, though, when we got up; we had a splendid view down the</Content><Content>gully, and the air was so much cooler and fresher than it had been at</Content><Content>the farm. We tethered our horses and gathered scrub to make a fire and</Content><Content>boil our kettle. In New Zealand no one thinks of having a meal without</Content><Content>drinking tea with it. We'd the jolliest picnic. The Higsons were famous</Content><Content>for their cakes, and they'd brought plenty with them. I can tell you we</Content><Content>didn't leave very many in the baskets.</Content><Content>"'Best put out our camp-fire,' Jake said when we'd finished; so we all</Content><Content>set to work and stamped it out carefully. Everything was so dry with the</Content><Content>heat that a spark might easily have set fire to the bush. Then we took</Content><Content>our cans and went off to find berries. There were heaps of them; so we</Content><Content>just picked and picked and picked for ever so long. Suddenly, when we</Content><Content>were talking, we heard a noise and looked round. There was a stampede</Content><Content>among the horses, and two of them, Billy's and Connie's, had broken</Content><Content>loose and were careering down the gully. We ran as quick as lightning to</Content><Content>the others for fear they might also free themselves and follow. I caught</Content><Content>Brownie by the bridle and soothed him as well as I could; but he was</Content><Content>very excited and trembling, and kept sniffing. Then I saw what had</Content><Content>frightened him, for a puff of wind brought a puff of smoke with it, and</Content><Content>ahead of us I saw a dark column whirl up towards the sky. Even the</Content><Content>youngest child who's lived in the bush knows what that means. When all</Content><Content>the grass and everything is so dry, the least thing will start a fire.</Content><Content>Sometimes campers-out are careless, and the wind blows sparks; sometimes</Content><Content>even a piece of an old bottle left lying about will act as a</Content><Content>burning-glass. We didn't inquire the reason; all we knew was that we</Content><Content>must tear back to the farm as rapidly as we could. Bush fires spread</Content><Content>fearfully fast, and this one would probably sweep straight down the</Content><Content>gorge.</Content><Content>"With two animals gone, luck was against us. Billy took Minnie's pony,</Content><Content>Connie mounted behind Jake, and I made Minnie come with me on Brownie,</Content><Content>because he was so strong, and better able to bear the double burden than</Content><Content>Pamela's horse. It was well for us we were good riders, for we pelted</Content><Content>down that gully fit to break our necks. Brownie was a sure-footed little</Content><Content>beast, but the way he went slithering over rocks would have scared me</Content><Content>if I hadn't been more afraid of the fire behind. We knew it would be</Content><Content>touch and go whether we could save the farm or not. If the men were all</Content><Content>far away there would be very little chance, though we meant to do our</Content><Content>level best.</Content><Content>"Well, as I was saying, we just stampeded down the gully, and our horses</Content><Content>kept their feet somehow. I guess we arrived at the house like a tornado.</Content><Content>We yelled out our news, and coo-eed to some of the men we could see</Content><Content>working in the distance. They came running at once, and Mrs. Higson sent</Content><Content>up the rocket that was used on the farm as a danger-signal. Fortunately</Content><Content>the rest of the men had only gone a short way. They were back almost</Content><Content>directly, and everybody set to work to make a wide ring of bare land</Content><Content>round the farm. They cut down trees, and threw up earth, and burnt a</Content><Content>great patch of grass, and we children helped too for all we were worth.</Content><Content>We were only just in time. We could see the great cloud of smoke coming</Content><Content>down the valley, and as it grew nearer we heard the roaring or the fire.</Content><Content>It seemed to bear down on us suddenly in a great burning sheet. For a</Content><Content>moment or two the air was so hot that we could scarcely breathe, then</Content><Content>the flame struck our ring of bare land, and parted in two and passed on</Content><Content>either side of us, leaving the farm as an island. We watched it go</Content><Content>crackling farther down the valley, till at last it spent itself in a</Content><Content>rocky creek where it had nothing to feed on. All the place it had passed</Content><Content>over was burnt to cinders, a horrible black mass. Only the house and</Content><Content>the buildings and a few fields round them were untouched. It was an</Content><Content>awful birthday for poor Pamela."</Content><Content>"Was your own farm hurt?" asked the girls breathlessly, as Rona paused</Content><Content>in her story.</Content><Content>"Not at all. You see it was in quite a different valley, and the fire</Content><Content>hadn't been near. Jake rode home with me, to make sure I was safe. Dad</Content><Content>hadn't even seen the smoke."</Content><Content>"Suppose you hadn't noticed the fire when you were up in the hills?"</Content><Content>"Then we should have been burnt to cinders, farm and all."</Content><Content>"I think Rona's most thrilling adventure will have to end our Stunt,"</Content><Content>said Mrs. Arnold. "It's nearly eight o'clock. Time to wind up and get</Content><Content>ready for supper. Attention, please! Each girl take her candle. Where's</Content><Content>our pianist? Torch-bearer Catherine, will you start the Good-night</Content><Content>Song?"</Content><Content>"I'm a candidate now, thanks to you!" exulted Rona to Ulyth; "perhaps by</Content><Content>Easter I may be a Wood-gatherer!"</Content><Content>"It's something to work for, isn't it?" said Mrs. Arnold, who happened</Content><Content>to overhear.</Content><Content>CHAPTER IX</Content><Content>A January Picnic</Content><Content>Winter in the Craigwen Valley, instead of proving a dreary season of</Content><Content>frost or fog, was apt to be as variable as April. Sheltered by the tall</Content><Content>mountains, the climate was mild, and though snow would lie on the peaks</Content><Content>of Penllwyd and Cwm Dinas it rarely rested on the lower levels. Very</Content><Content>early in January the garden at The Woodlands could boast brave clumps of</Content><Content>snowdrops and polyanthus, a venturous wallflower or two, and quite a</Content><Content>show of yellow jessamine over the south porch. The glade by the stream</Content><Content>never seemed to feel the touch of winter. Many of the oak-trees kept</Content><Content>their brown leaves till the new ones came to replace them, honeysuckle</Content><Content>trails and brambles continually put out verdant shoots, the lastrea</Content><Content>ferns that grew near the brink of the water showed tall green fronds</Content><Content>untouched by frost, and the moss was never more vivid. The glen, indeed,</Content><Content>had a special beauty in winter-time, for the bare boughs of the alders</Content><Content>took exquisite tender shades of purples and greys, warming into amber in</Content><Content>the sunshine, and defying the cunningest brush which artist could wield</Content><Content>to do them justice. By the middle of January the tightly rolled lambs'</Content><Content>tails on the hazels were unfolding themselves and beginning to scatter</Content><Content>pollen, and a few stray specimens of last summer's flowers, a belated</Content><Content>campion or hawkweed, would struggle out from the rough grass under a</Content><Content>protecting gorse-bush. The days varied: rain, the penalty for living</Content><Content>near mountains, often swept down the valley, bringing glorious</Content><Content>cloud-effects, and sending the stream swirling over its boulders with a</Content><Content>boom of myriad voices. Sometimes the sudden swelling of its tributaries</Content><Content>made the Craigwen River overtop its banks, flooding the low-lying</Content><Content>meadows till, augmented by the high tide, its waters filled the valley</Content><Content>from end to end like a lake. This occasional flooding of the marsh was</Content><Content>good for the fields, and ensured a rich hay-crop next summer, so the</Content><Content>school felt it could enjoy the picturesque aspect without needing to</Content><Content>deplore loss to the farmers.</Content><Content>On the 21st of January Miss Teddington had a birthday. She would have</Content><Content>suppressed the fact altogether if possible, or treated it in quite a</Content><Content>surreptitious and off-hand fashion, but with her autograph plainly</Content><Content>written in forty-nine separate birthday-books the Fates were against</Content><Content>her. She was obliged to receive the united congratulations of the</Content><Content>school, to accept, with feigned surprise, the present which was offered</Content><Content>her, and to say a few appropriate words of appreciation and thanks. She</Content><Content>did not do it well, for her manner was always abrupt, and even verged on</Content><Content>the ungracious, the greatest contrast to the bland and tactful</Content><Content>utterances of Miss Bowes.</Content><Content>This year the annual ceremony was gone through as usual: Catherine, as</Content><Content>head girl, proffered the good wishes and the volume of Carlyle; Lucy</Content><Content>Morris, on behalf of the Nature Study Union, handed a bouquet of</Content><Content>polyanthus, rosemary, periwinkle, pansies, and pink daisies culled from</Content><Content>the garden, the earliness of which Miss Teddington remarked upon, as</Content><Content>though she had not watched their progress for the last week.</Content><Content>"I'm very much obliged to you all," she said jerkily, looking</Content><Content>nevertheless as if she were longing to bolt for the door.</Content><Content>But she was not yet to make her escape. There was another time-honoured</Content><Content>ceremony to be observed. All eyes were turned to Miss Bowes, who rose as</Content><Content>usual to the occasion.</Content><Content>"I think, girls," she said pleasantly, "that, considering it is Miss</Content><Content>Teddington's birthday, we ought to take some special notice of the</Content><Content>occasion. Suppose we ask her to grant a holiday, so that we may make an</Content><Content>expedition in her honour. Who votes for this?"</Content><Content>Forty-nine hands were instantly raised, and forty-nine voices cried "I</Content><Content>do!" Miss Teddington, who utterly disapproved of odd holidays during</Content><Content>term-time, submitted with what grace she could muster, and gave a rather</Content><Content>chilly assent, which was immediately drowned in a storm of clapping. The</Content><Content>girls, who always suspected the Principals of an annual argument on the</Content><Content>subject, felt they had scored for this year at any rate, and were</Content><Content>certainly one holiday to the good.</Content><Content>There was no question at all as to where they should walk. Every 21st</Content><Content>January, weather permitting, they turned their steps in the same</Content><Content>direction. On certain portions of the marsh, near the river, grew fields</Content><Content>of wild snowdrops, and to go snowdropping before February set in was as</Content><Content>much an institution as turning their money when they first heard the</Content><Content>cuckoo, or wishing at the sight of the earliest white butterfly. As a</Content><Content>matter of fact, though the delicate fiction of asking for the holiday</Content><Content>was preserved, it was such a _sine qua non_ that the cook was prepared</Content><Content>for it. She had baked jam tartlets and made potted meat the day before,</Content><Content>and was already cutting sandwiches and packing them in greaseproof</Content><Content>paper. Every girl at The Woodlands possessed a basket, just as she owned</Content><Content>a penknife or a French dictionary. It was equally indispensable. She</Content><Content>would carry out her lunch in it, and bring it back filled with flowers,</Content><Content>berries, or nature specimens, as the case might be. Each was labelled</Content><Content>with the owner's name, and hung in a big cupboard under the stairs. Some</Content><Content>of the girls also used walking-sticks with crooked handles, which were</Content><Content>found convenient weapons for hooking down brambles or branches of</Content><Content>catkins.</Content><Content>Shortly after ten o'clock the school started, every Woodlander bearing</Content><Content>her basket, containing sandwiches, two tartlets, an orange, and a small</Content><Content>enamelled drinking-mug. There were to be no camp-fires to-day, so cold</Content><Content>water from the stream would have to suffice, and would make tea all the</Content><Content>more welcome when they returned home. It was quite a fine morning, with</Content><Content>sudden gleams of sunshine that burst from the clouds and spread in</Content><Content>long, slanting, golden rays over the valley; just the kind of sky the</Content><Content>early masters of landscape painting loved to put in their pictures, with</Content><Content>a background of neutral tint and a bright, scraped-out light in the</Content><Content>foreground. The little solitary farms stood out white here and there</Content><Content>against the green of the fields, the pine-trees on the hill-sides showed</Content><Content>darkly in contrast to the bare larches. Cwm Dinas was inky purple</Content><Content>to-day, but Penllwyd was capped with snow. Miss Bowes, who was not a</Content><Content>good walker, had not ventured to join the expedition, but Miss</Content><Content>Teddington strode along at the head of the party, chatting to some of</Content><Content>the Sixth Form.</Content><Content>"I'm sure she's wishing she were giving a Latin lesson instead," said</Content><Content>Lizzie Lonsdale. "She looks rather grim."</Content><Content>"Perhaps she's remembering she's a year older to-day," returned Beth</Content><Content>Broadway.</Content><Content>"How old is she, do you think?" giggled Addie Knighton.</Content><Content>"That, my child, is a secret that will never be divulged. I dare say</Content><Content>you'd like to know?"</Content><Content>"I should, immensely."</Content><Content>"Then you won't be gratified, unless you go to Somerset House and hunt</Content><Content>her name up in the register of births. Even then you'd find it</Content><Content>difficult, for you don't know her Christian name, only her initial."</Content><Content>"Yes; she never will write more than 'M. Teddington' in anybody's</Content><Content>birthday-book. M might stand for Mary or Martha or Margaret or</Content><Content>Millicent or anything. Doesn't even Miss Bowes know?"</Content><Content>"If she does she won't tell. It's a state-secret."</Content><Content>"Well, never mind; we call her Teddie, and that will do."</Content><Content>Many were the ingenious devices which the girls had adopted for trying</Content><Content>to find out both Miss Teddington's Christian name and her age. They</Content><Content>spoke of historic events that had happened before their parents had been</Content><Content>born, fondly hoping she might betray some memory of them and commit</Content><Content>herself. But she was not to be caught; she treated all events, however</Content><Content>recent or old, from a purely impersonal standpoint, and left them still</Content><Content>in the dark as to whether she was an infant in arms at the time or an</Content><Content>adult able to enjoy the newspapers. On the subject of names she was</Content><Content>indifferent, and would express no opinion on the relative merits of</Content><Content>Mary, Martha, Margaret, Millicent, Marion, Muriel, Mona, or Maud.</Content><Content>"It's either plain Mary, or something so fearfully fancy she won't own</Content><Content>up to it," decided the girls.</Content><Content>In whatever decade Miss Teddington's birthday placed her, this year she</Content><Content>was certainly in the prime of life and energy as concerned the school.</Content><Content>Her keen eyes noticed everything, and woe betide the slacker who thought</Content><Content>to escape her, and dared bring an unprepared lesson to class. Her</Content><Content>sarcasms on such occasions made her victims writhe, though they were apt</Content><Content>to be witty enough to amuse the rest of the form. Though, like John</Content><Content>Gilpin's wife, she was on pleasure bent to-day, she never for a moment</Content><Content>forgot she was in charge, and kept turning to see that everybody was</Content><Content>following, and nobody straggling far off in the rear.</Content><Content>It was a three-mile walk from The Woodlands to the snowdrop</Content><Content>meadows--first along the high road, with an occasional short cut across</Content><Content>a field or through a spinney, then down a deep, narrow lane past a farm,</Content><Content>where the sight of a new-born lamb (the first of the season) caused</Content><Content>great excitement. Some of the girls, who loved old superstitions,</Content><Content>pretended to divine their luck by whether it was standing facing them or</Content><Content>otherwise when they first caught a glimpse of it; but, the general</Content><Content>verdict deciding that it was exactly sideways, they found it impossible</Content><Content>to give any accurate predictions for the future.</Content><Content>"You'd better keep to something vague that can be construed two ways,</Content><Content>like the Delphic Oracle or _Old Moore's Almanac_," laughed Ulyth.</Content><Content>Once past the farm the walk began to grow specially interesting. The</Content><Content>deep lane, only intended for use in summer, when carts brought loads of</Content><Content>hay from the marsh, was turned by winter rains into the bed of a stream.</Content><Content>The girls picked their way at first along the bank, then by jumping from</Content><Content>stone to stone, but finally the water grew so deep it was impossible to</Content><Content>proceed farther without wading. They had been in the same emergency</Content><Content>before, so it did not daunt their enthusiasm. One and all they scaled</Content><Content>the high, wide, loosely built wall to their left. Here they could walk</Content><Content>as on a terrace, with the flooded lane on one side and on the other the</Content><Content>rushing Porth Powys stream, making its hurrying way to join the Craigwen</Content><Content>River. It was not at all an easy progress, for the wall was overgrown</Content><Content>with hazel bushes and a tangle of brambles, and its unmortared surface</Content><Content>had deep holes, into which the unwary might put a foot. For several</Content><Content>hundred yards they struggled on, decidedly to the detriment of their</Content><Content>clothing, and rather encumbered by their baskets; then at last they</Content><Content>reached the particular corner they were seeking, and scrambled down into</Content><Content>the meadow.</Content><Content>This field was such a favourite with the girls that they had come to</Content><Content>regard it almost as their own property. Miss Teddington had found it out</Content><Content>many years ago, and its discovery was always considered a point in her</Content><Content>roll of merit. It was an expanse of grassy land, bounded on one side by</Content><Content>the Porth Powys stream and on the other by a deep dyke, and leading down</Content><Content>over a rushy tract to the reed-grown banks of the river. The view over</Content><Content>the many miles of marshland, with the blue mountains rising up behind</Content><Content>and the silvery gleam of the river, was superb. The brown, quivering,</Content><Content>feathery reeds made a glorious foreground for the amber and vivid green</Content><Content>of the banks farther on; and the gorgeous sky effects of rolling clouds,</Content><Content>glinting sun, and patches of bluest heaven were like the beginning of</Content><Content>one of St. John's visions.</Content><Content>Near at hand, dotted all over the field, bloomed the wild snowdrops in</Content><Content>utmost profusion, with a looser habit of growth, a longer stalk, and a</Content><Content>wider flower than the garden variety. Lovely pure-white blossoms, with</Content><Content>their tiny green markings, they stood like fairy bells among the grass,</Content><Content>so dainty and perfect, it seemed almost a sacrilege to disturb them. The</Content><Content>girls, however, were not troubled with any such scruples, and set to</Content><Content>work to pick in hot haste.</Content><Content>"I'm going down by the stream," said Ulyth; "one gets far the best there</Content><Content>if one hunts about, and I brought my stick."</Content><Content>Rona, Addie and Lizzie joined her, and with considerable difficulty</Content><Content>scrambled down to the water's edge. For those who preferred quality to</Content><Content>quantity, and who did not mind getting torn by briers, this was</Content><Content>undoubtedly the place to come. In pockets of fine river-sand, their</Content><Content>roots stretching into the stream, grew the very biggest and finest of</Content><Content>the snowdrops. Most of them peeped through a very tangle of brambles;</Content><Content>but who minded scratched arms and torn sleeves to secure such treasures?</Content><Content>"Look at these. The stalks must be nine inches long, and the flower's</Content><Content>nearly as big as a Lent lily," exulted Ulyth. "I shall send them to</Content><Content>Mother, with some hazel catkins and some lovely moss."</Content><Content>"Everybody will be sending away boxes to-night," said Addie. "The</Content><Content>postman will have a load."</Content><Content>"What's that?" cried Lizzie, for a sudden rush and scuffle sounded on</Content><Content>the other side of the stream, a rat leaped wildly from the bank, and a</Content><Content>shaved poodle half jumped, half fell after it into the water.</Content><Content>The rat was gone in an eighth of a second, but the dog found himself in</Content><Content>difficulties. It was a case of "look before you leap", and a fat,</Content><Content>wheezy, French poodle is not at home in a quick-rushing stream.</Content><Content>"Oh, the poor little beast's drowning!" exclaimed Ulyth in horror.</Content><Content>Rona, with extreme promptitude, had flown to the rescue. Close by where</Content><Content>they stood the trunk of a half-fallen alder stretched out over the</Content><Content>water. It was green and slippery, and anything but an inviting bridge,</Content><Content>but she crawled along it somehow, and, clinging with one hand, contrived</Content><Content>to reach the dog's collar with the other and hold him up. What she would</Content><Content>have done next it is impossible to say, for he was too heavy to lift in</Content><Content>her already precarious position; but at that moment a gentleman,</Content><Content>evidently in quest of his pet, parted the hazel boughs and took in the</Content><Content>situation at a glance.</Content><Content>"Hold hard a moment," he called, and, scrambling down the bank, managed</Content><Content>to make a long arm and hook his stick into the poodle's collar and drag</Content><Content>the almost strangled creature to shore.</Content><Content>Until Rona had cautiously wriggled round on the bough, and crept back</Content><Content>safely, the spectators watched in considerable anxiety. They need not</Content><Content>have been alarmed, however, for after her many New Zealand experiences</Content><Content>she thought this a very poor affair.</Content><Content>The owner of the dog shouted his thanks from the opposite bank of the</Content><Content>stream and disappeared behind the high hedge. The whole episode had not</Content><Content>taken five minutes.</Content><Content>"Do you know who that was? It was Lord Glyncraig," said Addie in rather</Content><Content>awestruck tones.</Content><Content>"Was it? Well, I'm sure I don't care," returned Rona a trifle defiantly.</Content><Content>"I'd have saved John Jones's dog quite as readily."</Content><Content>"What a pity he didn't ask your name! He might have invited you to tea</Content><Content>at Plas Cafn, then you'd have scored over Stephie no end."</Content><Content>"I'm sure I don't want to go to tea at Plas Cafn, thank you," snapped</Content><Content>Rona, rather out of temper.</Content><Content>"But think of the fun of it," persisted Addie. "I only wish they'd ask</Content><Content>me."</Content><Content>"They won't ask any of us, so what's the use of talking?" said Lizzie.</Content><Content>"Let's go back to the others; it must be time for lunch."</Content><Content>They found the rest of the girls seated on the wall, as being the driest</Content><Content>spot available, and already attacking their packets of sandwiches. Some</Content><Content>had even reached the jam-tartlet stage.</Content><Content>"It's a good thing we've each got our own private basket, or there</Content><Content>wouldn't be much left for you," shouted Mary Acton. "Where have you been</Content><Content>all this while?"</Content><Content>"Consorting with members of the Peerage," said Addie airily. "Oh yes, my</Content><Content>dear girl! We've had quite what you might call a confidential talk down</Content><Content>by the stream with Lord Glyncraig."</Content><Content>"Not really?" asked Stephanie, pricking up her ears.</Content><Content>"Really and truly! He's not your special property any longer. Rona has</Content><Content>quite supplanted you."</Content><Content>"I don't believe it. You're ragging." Stephanie was rather pink and</Content><Content>indignant.</Content><Content>"Ask the others, if you want to know."</Content><Content>No one was particularly sorry to take a rest after all the scrambling.</Content><Content>The lunch tasted good out-of-doors, and the last tartlet had soon</Content><Content>disappeared. Rona, perched on a tree-stump, began her orange, and tossed</Content><Content>long yellow strands of peel on to the bank below her.</Content><Content>"Oh, stop that, before Teddie catches you!" urged Ulyth; but she was too</Content><Content>late, for Miss Teddington had already spied the offending pieces.</Content><Content>"Who threw those?" she demanded. "Then, Rona Mitchell, you ought to be</Content><Content>ashamed of yourself. Go and pick them up at once, and put them inside</Content><Content>your basket. What do you think the field will look like if more than</Content><Content>fifty people strew it with orange-peel and sandwich-paper! We don't come</Content><Content>here to spoil the beautiful spots we have been enjoying. I should be</Content><Content>utterly disgraced if the school behaved like a party of cheap-trippers.</Content><Content>Woodlanders ought to respect all natural scenery. I thought you would</Content><Content>have learnt that by this time, but it appears you haven't. Don't forget</Content><Content>it again."</Content><Content>Much crushed, Rona collected the peel, and, wrapping it carefully in her</Content><Content>piece of sandwich-paper, put it in the very bottom of her basket, under</Content><Content>a layer of catkins. The girls had brought bobbins of thread with them,</Content><Content>and were making their snowdrops into little bunches, with ivy leaves and</Content><Content>lambs'-tails from the hazel. A few lucky explorers had even found some</Content><Content>palm opening on the sallows. Several had nature notes to contribute.</Content><Content>Nellie Barlow and Gladys Broughton had seen a real weasel, and plumed</Content><Content>themselves accordingly, till Evie Isherwood capped their story by</Content><Content>producing the remains of a last year's chaffinch's nest she had found in</Content><Content>a tree.</Content><Content>"If I said I'd seen a snake, should I be believed?" whispered Rona.</Content><Content>"Certainly not. Everyone knows that snakes hibernate; so don't try it</Content><Content>on," returned Ulyth, laughing.</Content><Content>"Half-past two. We must be going back at once, girls, or there won't be</Content><Content>time to send off your snowdrops," said Miss Teddington. "Pack your</Content><Content>baskets and come along."</Content><Content>CHAPTER X</Content><Content>Trespassers Beware!</Content><Content>The girls left the snowdrop field with reluctance, though they realized</Content><Content>the necessity for hurry. Nearly everyone wished to dispatch her spoils</Content><Content>home, and unless the boxes were sent very early to the post-office the</Content><Content>chances were that there would not be time for the postmaster to stamp</Content><Content>them officially, and that they might languish somewhere in the</Content><Content>background of the village shop until next day, and consequently arrive</Content><Content>at their destination in an utterly withered condition.</Content><Content>The school scrambled back along the top of the wall, therefore, with</Content><Content>what haste the brambles and hazel-bushes allowed them, splashed</Content><Content>recklessly among the pools of the flooded lane, and regained the high</Content><Content>road with quite record speed. Ulyth, walking with Lizzie Lonsdale, had</Content><Content>left Rona in the rear. Rona, owing to her intimacy with Ulyth, tried to</Content><Content>tag on to V B, often receiving snubs from some of its members. Her own</Content><Content>form-mates were all considerably younger than herself. At first they had</Content><Content>teased her shamelessly, but since the Christmas holidays, recognizing</Content><Content>that she was gaining a more established position in the school, they</Content><Content>had begun to treat her more mercifully. Some of them were really rather</Content><Content>jolly children, and though twelve seems young to fourteen, the poor</Content><Content>Cuckoo was still a lonely enough bird to welcome any crumbs of</Content><Content>friendship thrown in her way.</Content><Content>At the present moment Winnie Fowler and Hattie Goodwin were clinging to</Content><Content>her arms, one on either side. Their motives, I fear, were a trifle</Content><Content>mixed. They found Rona amusing and liked her company, but also they were</Content><Content>tired and found if they dragged a little she would pull them along</Content><Content>without remonstrance.</Content><Content>"My shoes are ever so wet," boasted Winnie. "I plumped down deep in the</Content><Content>lane, and the water went right through the laces at the top. It</Content><Content>squelches as I walk. I feel like a soldier in the trenches."</Content><Content>"I've torn my coat in three places," said Hattie, not to be outdone. "It</Content><Content>will be a nice little piece of work for Mrs. Johnson to mend it."</Content><Content>"Glad they don't make us mend our own coats here," grunted Winnie.</Content><Content>"Miss Bowes would be ashamed to see me in it if I did," Hattie chuckled,</Content><Content>"but I've knitted a whole sock since Christmas, and turned the heel too.</Content><Content>Cuckoo, aren't you tired?"</Content><Content>"Not a scrap," replied Rona, who was stumping along sturdily in spite of</Content><Content>her encumbrances.</Content><Content>"Well, I am. I wish it wasn't three miles back."</Content><Content>"It's not more than two as the crow flies."</Content><Content>"But we're not crows, and we can't fly, and there are no aeroplanes to</Content><Content>give us a lift. We've got to tramp, tramp, tramp along the hard high</Content><Content>road. I begin to sympathize with Tommies on the march."</Content><Content>"Why need we stick to the high road?" said Rona, pausing suddenly. "If</Content><Content>we struck across country we'd save a mile or more. Look, The Woodlands</Content><Content>is over there, and if we made a beeline for it we'd cut off all that</Content><Content>enormous round by Cefn Mawr. Who's game to try?"</Content><Content>"Oh, I am, if we can dodge Teddie!"</Content><Content>"Likewise this child," added Winnie.</Content><Content>"Oh, we'll dodge Teddie right enough! It will be good scouting</Content><Content>practice," chuckled Rona. "Sit down on that stone and tie your shoelace,</Content><Content>and we'll wait for you while the others go on; then we'll bolt through</Content><Content>that gate and over the wall into the next field."</Content><Content>The idea that it was scouting practice lent a vestige of sanction to the</Content><Content>proceeding. Winnie took the hint, and adjusted her shoelaces with</Content><Content>elaborate care and deliberation.</Content><Content>"Don't be all day over that," said Miss Teddington, who passed by but</Content><Content>did not wait.</Content><Content>The moment she was round the corner of the road, and the high hedge</Content><Content>screened her from view, the three deserters were through the gate and</Content><Content>running across the field. They scaled a wall without much difficulty,</Content><Content>and found themselves on a wide gorse-grown pasture. Though they could</Content><Content>not now see the chimneys of The Woodlands in the distance, there were</Content><Content>other landmarks quite sufficient to guide them. They plodded on</Content><Content>cheerfully.</Content><Content>"It would be prime to have our snowdrops all packed up before the</Content><Content>others got back," ventured Hattie. "They'd be so surprised. They'd</Content><Content>wonder how we'd stolen a march on them."</Content><Content>"If Teddie asks where we were, we can truly say 'at the front'," Winnie</Content><Content>giggled.</Content><Content>"You'd better not pick up any nature specimens, though, or she'll want</Content><Content>to know 'the exact locality' where you found them."</Content><Content>"Um--yes! That might be awkward. This toadstool shall stay on its native</Content><Content>heath, in case it tells tales."</Content><Content>It was rather a fascinating walk, all amongst the gorse-bushes. None of</Content><Content>the three had been there before, and instinctively the younger ones left</Content><Content>Rona to lead the way. Her bump of locality had been well developed in</Content><Content>New Zealand, so she strode on with confidence. But the ground shelved</Content><Content>down suddenly, revealing a natural feature upon which they had not</Content><Content>counted, a fairly wide brook, running between sandy banks. Here indeed</Content><Content>was an obstacle. Winnie and Hattie stared at it with blank faces and</Content><Content>groaned.</Content><Content>"We'd forgotten the wretched Llanelwyn stream. What atrocious luck!</Content><Content>Don't believe there's the ghost of a bridge anywhere. Shall we have to</Content><Content>go back?"</Content><Content>"I'm not going back," declared Rona sturdily. "There must be some way of</Content><Content>getting over it some where. Come along and we'll prospect."</Content><Content>"Oh, for the wings of a dove!" sighed Hattie. "Even those of the</Content><Content>raggedest sparrow would be welcome."</Content><Content>"Better wish yourself a fish, for you may have to try swimming," grunted</Content><Content>Winnie.</Content><Content>"I can't swim--not a stroke! You'll suggest I shall jump it next, I</Content><Content>suppose. Look here, we shall have to go back. There's nothing else for</Content><Content>it. Rona! Corona Mitchell! Corona Margarita! Cuckoo! Where've you gone</Content><Content>to?"</Content><Content>"Coo--ee!" came in reply from the distance, and presently Rona appeared</Content><Content>beckoning vigorously.</Content><Content>"We're--going--back," shouted Hattie.</Content><Content>"No, no! Come along here."</Content><Content>Anxious to see if she had found any solution of the problem, the others</Content><Content>pelted down a slope and joined her.</Content><Content>"Here's our bridge," said Rona proudly, as soon as they rounded the</Content><Content>corner.</Content><Content>"That thing!" exclaimed Winnie, looking aghast at the decidedly slim</Content><Content>pole, that was fixed across the stream as a cattle bar.</Content><Content>"I'm not a tight-rope dancer, thank you!" sneered Hattie rather</Content><Content>indignantly.</Content><Content>"It'll be quite easy," Rona urged.</Content><Content>"Oh, I dare say! You won't find me trying to walk across it, I can tell</Content><Content>you."</Content><Content>"I didn't ask you to walk. I'm going to sit on it cross-legged, like a</Content><Content>tailor, and shuffle myself over. It's broad enough for that. I'll go</Content><Content>first."</Content><Content>"Oh, I daren't! I'd drop in!" wailed the younger ones in chorus.</Content><Content>"Now don't funk. What two sillies you are! It won't be as hard as you</Content><Content>think. Just watch me do it."</Content><Content>Fortunately the pole had two great advantages: it was firmly fixed in</Content><Content>the bank on either side, so that it did not sway about, and, being the</Content><Content>trunk of a fir-tree with the bark still left on, its surface offered</Content><Content>some grip. Rona's progress was slow but steady. She worked herself over</Content><Content>by a few inches at a time. When she reached the water's edge on the far</Content><Content>side she dropped on to a patch of silver sand and hurrahed.</Content><Content>"Buck up, and come along," she yelled lustily.</Content><Content>This was scouting with a vengeance, and more than the others had</Content><Content>bargained for; but the stronger will prevailed, and though they shook in</Content><Content>their shoes they were persuaded to make the experiment.</Content><Content>"I'm all dithering," panted Hattie, as Winnie pushed her forward to try</Content><Content>first.</Content><Content>It was not as bad as she had expected. She was able to cling tightly</Content><Content>with hands and knees, and though she had one awful moment in the middle,</Content><Content>when she thought she was overbalancing, she reached Rona's outstretched</Content><Content>hand in due course.</Content><Content>"You squealed like a pig," said the Cuckoo.</Content><Content>"I thought I was done for. Wouldn't you like to feel how my heart's</Content><Content>beating?"</Content><Content>"No, I shouldn't. Don't be affected. Come along, Win. We can't wait all</Content><Content>day. I'll fish you out if you tumble in, I promise you. It isn't deep</Content><Content>enough to drown you."</Content><Content>With many protestations, Winnie, really very much scared, followed the</Content><Content>others' lead, and got along quite successfully till within a foot of the</Content><Content>brink; then the sudden mooing of a cow on the bank startled her, and so</Content><Content>upset her equilibrium that she splashed into the water, wetting one leg</Content><Content>thoroughly.</Content><Content>"Ugh! My shoes were squelchy enough before," she lamented. "You can't</Content><Content>think how horrid it is."</Content><Content>"Never mind, you've got across."</Content><Content>"But you might sympathize."</Content><Content>"Haven't time. We shall have to hurry up if we mean to be back before</Content><Content>the others."</Content><Content>"Did you think the cow was Teddie calling you?" laughed Hattie, who,</Content><Content>having got her own trial over, could afford to jest at other people's</Content><Content>misfortunes.</Content><Content>"You'd have jumped yourself. Oh dear, I spilt most of my snowdrops,</Content><Content>though I did tie the basket round my neck!"</Content><Content>"Never mind; you can't fish them out of the stream now. I'll give you</Content><Content>some of mine. Here, take these," said Rona. "I've nobody to send them</Content><Content>to," she added, half to herself, as she climbed the bank.</Content><Content>"Oh, thanks awfully! I always send Mother a big bunch. She looks forward</Content><Content>to them. I've brought a cardboard box from home on purpose to pack them</Content><Content>in, because the cook runs quite out of starch-boxes. Some of the girls</Content><Content>last year had to wrap theirs just in brown paper. If you don't want</Content><Content>yours, can you spare me a few more?"</Content><Content>"I'll keep just these to put in my bedroom, and you may have the rest if</Content><Content>you like," replied Rona, stalking ahead.</Content><Content>Every now and then the sense of her loneliness smote her. She would</Content><Content>probably be the only girl in the school who was not sending flowers</Content><Content>away to-night. How different it would be if she had anybody in England</Content><Content>who took an interest in her and cared to receive her snowdrops!</Content><Content>"It's no use crying for the moon," she decided, blinking hard lest she</Content><Content>should betray symptoms of weakness before her juniors. "When a thing</Content><Content>can't be helped it can't, and there's an end of it."</Content><Content>"Cuckoo! Corona Margarita! Do wait for us! You walk like the wind."</Content><Content>"Or as if a bull were chasing you," panted Hattie, overtaking her and</Content><Content>claiming a supporting arm. "Do you see where we've got ourselves to? The</Content><Content>only way out of this is to go straight through the Glynmaen Wood."</Content><Content>"Well, and why shouldn't we go through the Glynmaen Wood? Is it any</Content><Content>different to any other wood?"</Content><Content>"No, only they're horribly particular about trespassing. They stick up</Content><Content>all kinds of notices warning people off."</Content><Content>"What rubbish! Why, in New Zealand we go where we like."</Content><Content>"Oh, I dare say, in New Zealand!"</Content><Content>"Look, there's a notice up there," said Winnie, pointing over the hedge</Content><Content>to a tree whereon was nailed a weather-stained board bearing the</Content><Content>inhospitable legend: "Trespassers Beware".</Content><Content>Rona stared at it quite belligerently.</Content><Content>"I should like to pull it down," she observed. "What right has anybody</Content><Content>to try to keep places all to themselves?"</Content><Content>"I suppose it belongs to Lord Glyncraig."</Content><Content>"All the more shame to him then. I shall take a particular pleasure in</Content><Content>going, just because he sticks up 'Don't'."</Content><Content>"Suppose we're caught?"</Content><Content>"My blessed babes, you don't suppose I've come all this short cut and</Content><Content>scrambled over a pole to be turned back by a trespass notice! Do you</Content><Content>want to cross the stream again and trail home by the road?"</Content><Content>"Rather not!"</Content><Content>"Then I'll give you a boost to get over the fence there."</Content><Content>The property was well protected. It took Rona's best efforts to help her</Content><Content>companions to scale the high oak boards. When they had all dropped</Content><Content>safely to the other side they set off through the trees in the direction</Content><Content>they judged would bring them out nearest to The Woodlands.</Content><Content>Three girls in thick shoes do not pass absolutely silently through a</Content><Content>wood, especially if they indulge in giggles. Winnie and Hattie,</Content><Content>moreover, could never be together without chattering incessantly. For</Content><Content>the moment they had forgotten every principle of scouting. In that</Content><Content>quiet, secluded spot their shrill voices rang out with extreme</Content><Content>clearness. A rabbit or two scuttled away, and a pheasant flew off with a</Content><Content>whirr. Presently another and heavier pair of boots might be heard</Content><Content>tramping towards them, the bushes parted, and a dour-looking face, with</Content><Content>lantern jaws and a stubbly chin, regarded them grimly. The gamekeeper</Content><Content>glowered a moment, then growled out:</Content><Content>"What are you three a-doing here?"</Content><Content>"That's our own business," retorted Rona briskly.</Content><Content>"Indeed? Well, it happens to be my business too. You're trespassing, and</Content><Content>you know it."</Content><Content>"We're doing no harm."</Content><Content>"Aren't you? I suppose it's nothing to scare every pheasant in the wood.</Content><Content>Oh dear no!"</Content><Content>"What nonsense! It was only one," exclaimed Rona, standing up against</Content><Content>the bullying tone. "You're making the most unnecessary fuss. What right</Content><Content>have you to stop us?"</Content><Content>"More right than you've got to be here. I won't have anybody in these</Content><Content>woods, schoolgirls or no schoolgirls, so just you get back the way you</Content><Content>came, or----"</Content><Content>"That will do, Jordan," said a voice behind him.</Content><Content>The keeper started, turned, and touched his cap obsequiously.</Content><Content>"Beg pardon, my lord, but the trespassing that goes on here gets past</Content><Content>bearing, and wants putting a stop to."</Content><Content>"Very well, I'll settle it myself," and Lord Glyncraig--for it was</Content><Content>he--readjusted his glasses and stared reprovingly at the three</Content><Content>delinquents.</Content><Content>"Ah! girls from The Woodlands--evidently out of bounds. I shall have to</Content><Content>report you to your headmistress, I'm afraid. Your names, please."</Content><Content>"Winnie Fowler," "Hattie Goodwin," murmured two subdued voices.</Content><Content>Rona did not answer at all. She kept her head down and her eyes fixed on</Content><Content>the ground.</Content><Content>"It's--it's surely not the same girl who did me such a service this</Content><Content>morning on the marsh? Then I must repeat my thanks. Now, look here,</Content><Content>you've been up to some mischief, all three of you. Get back to school as</Content><Content>quick as you can, and I'll say nothing about it! There! Off you go!"</Content><Content>Without another word the sinners pelted along through the wood, never</Content><Content>pausing till they reached the railing and climbed over on to the high</Content><Content>road. Here, on free ground, they felt at liberty to express their</Content><Content>indignation.</Content><Content>"He's a nasty, horrid old thing to turn us out!" panted Hattie.</Content><Content>"How he looked at you, Rona!" said Winnie. "He stared and stared and</Content><Content>stared!"</Content><Content>"Wondering where he'd seen me before, I suppose. I expect the green</Content><Content>stains on my coat reminded him. I got them hauling up his precious dog."</Content><Content>"It wasn't with him in the wood."</Content><Content>"Oh, it's sitting by the fire drinking linseed tea! It looked a pampered</Content><Content>brute."</Content><Content>"We shall have to scoot to keep clear of Teddie."</Content><Content>"All right. Scooterons-nous. Thank goodness, there's the hedge of The</Content><Content>Woodlands! We'll slip in through the little side gate."</Content><Content>The three certainly merited discovery for their misdeeds, but on this</Content><Content>occasion they evaded justice; for, as luck would have it, they reached</Content><Content>the house just a moment or two before the rest of the school, and Miss</Content><Content>Teddington, who was in a hurry to pack her boxes of snowdrops, concluded</Content><Content>that they must have been in front with Ulyth and Lizzie, and did not</Content><Content>stop to remember that she had left them tying Winnie's shoelace by the</Content><Content>roadside. It was seldom that such a palpable lapse escaped her keen eye</Content><Content>and even keener comprehension; so they might thank their fortunate stars</Content><Content>for their escape. Hattie and Winnie made great capital out of the</Content><Content>adventure, and recounted all the details, much exaggerated, to a</Content><Content>thrilled audience in IV B.</Content><Content>Rona did not mention the matter to Ulyth. Perhaps, knowing her</Content><Content>room-mate's standards, in her heart of hearts she was rather ashamed of</Content><Content>it.</Content><Content>CHAPTER XI</Content><Content>Rona receives News</Content><Content>Ulyth and Lizzie Lonsdale were sitting cosily in the latter's bedroom.</Content><Content>It was Shrove Tuesday, and, with perhaps some idea of imitating the</Content><Content>Continental habit of keeping carnival, Miss Bowes for that one day</Content><Content>relaxed her rule prohibiting sweets, and allowed the school a special</Content><Content>indulgence. Needless to say, they availed themselves of it to the</Content><Content>fullest extent. Some had boxes of chocolate sent them from home; others</Content><Content>visited the village shop and purchased delicacies from the big bottles</Content><Content>displayed in the windows; while a favoured few managed to borrow pans</Content><Content>from the kitchen and perform some cookery with the aid of friends.</Content><Content>Lizzie had been concocting peppermint creams, and she now leant back</Content><Content>luxuriously in a basket-chair and handed the box to Ulyth. The two girls</Content><Content>were friends, and often met for a chat. Ulyth sometimes wished they</Content><Content>could be room-mates. Though Rona was immensely improved, she was still</Content><Content>not an entirely congenial companion. Her lack of education and early</Content><Content>training made it difficult for her to understand half the things Ulyth</Content><Content>wanted to talk about, and it was troublesome always to have to explain.</Content><Content>In an equal friendship there must be give and take, and to poor Rona</Content><Content>Ulyth was constantly giving her very best, and receiving nothing in</Content><Content>return. Lizzie, on the contrary, was inspiring. She played and painted</Content><Content>well, was fond of reading, and was ready to help to organize any forward</Content><Content>movement in the school. She and Ulyth pottered together over</Content><Content>photography, mounted specimens for the museum, tried new stitches in</Content><Content>embroidery, and worked at the same patterns in chip carving. The two</Content><Content>girls were at about the same level of attainment in most things, for if</Content><Content>Ulyth had greater originality, Lizzie was the more steady and plodding.</Content><Content>It was Ulyth's failing to take things up very hotly at first, and then</Content><Content>grow tired of them. She was apt to have half a dozen unfinished pieces</Content><Content>of fancywork on hand, and her locker in the carpentry-room held several</Content><Content>ambitious attempts that had never reached fruition.</Content><Content>Lizzie, as she munched her peppermint creams, turned over the pages of a</Content><Content>volume of Dryden's poems, and made an occasional note. Each form kept a</Content><Content>"Calendar of Quotations" hung up in its classroom, the daily extracts</Content><Content>for which were supplied by the girls in rotation. It was Lizzie's turn</Content><Content>to provide the gems for the following week, and she was hunting for</Content><Content>something suitable.</Content><Content>"I wish Miss Bowes had given me Shakespeare," she said. "I could have</Content><Content>got heaps of bits out of my birthday-book, just suitable for the month,</Content><Content>too. I don't know why she should have pitched on Dryden. No one's going</Content><Content>to be particularly cheered next week with my quotations. I've got:</Content><Content>"'MONDAY</Content><Content>    "'When I consider life, 't is all a cheat;</Content><Content>      Yet, fooled with hope, men favour the deceit,</Content><Content>      Trust on, and think to-morrow will repay;</Content><Content>      To-morrow's falser than the former day.'</Content><Content>"'TUESDAY</Content><Content>    "'All human things are subject to decay,</Content><Content>      And when Fate summons, monarchs must obey.'"</Content><Content>"That's dismal, in all conscience!" put in Ulyth.</Content><Content>"'WEDNESDAY</Content><Content>    "'Great wits are sure to madness near allied,</Content><Content>      And thin partitions do their bounds divide.'</Content><Content>"That sounds quite as dismal, does it not? I wonder why Scott calls</Content><Content>Dryden 'glorious John'? I think he's rather a dismal poet. Listen to</Content><Content>this:</Content><Content>    "'In dreams they fearful precipices tread,</Content><Content>      Or, shipwrecked, labour to some distant shore,</Content><Content>      Or in dark churches walk amongst the dead:</Content><Content>      They wake with horror, and dare sleep no more.'</Content><Content>Shall I put it down for Thursday?"</Content><Content>"For goodness' sake don't! You'll give us all the creeps," laughed</Content><Content>Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Well, it won't be a champion week."</Content><Content>"I'll tell you what you might do. Draw some illustrations round the</Content><Content>mottoes. That would make them more interesting."</Content><Content>"Oh, I dare say! I haven't time to bother."</Content><Content>"Nonsense, you have! I'll do some of them for you. You needn't be</Content><Content>original. It doesn't take long to copy things."</Content><Content>"Will you do four, then, if I do three?"</Content><Content>"All serene. I'll begin this evening if you'll give me the cards."</Content><Content>Ulyth dashed off quite a pretty little pen-and-ink sketch in ten minutes</Content><Content>after tea, and put the cards by in her drawer, intending to finish them</Content><Content>during "handicraft hour" the next day; but she completely forgot all</Content><Content>about them, and never remembered their existence till Saturday, when she</Content><Content>came across them by accident, and was much dismayed at her discovery.</Content><Content>"I'll have to do them somehow, or Lizzie'll never forgive me," she</Content><Content>ruminated. "I must knock them off just as fast as I can. I could copy</Content><Content>those little figures from the _American Gems_; they're in outline, and</Content><Content>will be very easy. Oh, bother! It's cataloguing day, and one's not</Content><Content>supposed to use the library. What atrocious luck!"</Content><Content>Twice during the term the books of the school library were called in for</Content><Content>purposes of review by the librarian, and on those days nobody was</Content><Content>allowed to borrow any of the volumes. It was most unfortunate for Ulyth</Content><Content>that this special Saturday should be the one devoted by the monitresses</Content><Content>to the purpose. She had failed Lizzie so often before in their joint</Content><Content>projects that she did not wish to encounter fresh reproaches. Somehow</Content><Content>three illustrations had to be provided, and that within the space of</Content><Content>about half an hour. Ulyth was fairly clever at drawing, but she was not</Content><Content>capable of producing the pictures out of her head. She must obtain a</Content><Content>copy, and that quickly.</Content><Content>"Helen Cooper's librarian this month," she thought. "I wonder if she's</Content><Content>finished checking the catalogue yet? I saw her walking down the stream</Content><Content>five minutes ago with Mabel Hoyle. Why shouldn't I have the _American</Content><Content>Gems_ for half an hour? It wouldn't do any harm. It really is the merest</Content><Content>red tape that we mayn't use the books. I shall just take French leave</Content><Content>and borrow it."</Content><Content>Ulyth went at once to the library. Helen had evidently been at work</Content><Content>there, for the list lay open, with a sheet of paper near, recording the</Content><Content>condition of some of the copies. A glue-pot and some rolls of</Content><Content>transparent gummed edging showed that Helen had been busy mending</Content><Content>battered covers and torn pages. She probably meant to finish them after</Content><Content>tea. The book of American gems was in its usual place on the shelf. The</Content><Content>temptation was irresistible. Ulyth did not notice, as she was taking it</Content><Content>down, that someone with a smooth head of sleek fair hair was peeping</Content><Content>round the corner of the door, and that a pair of not too friendly blue</Content><Content>eyes were watching the deed. If flying footsteps whisked along the</Content><Content>corridor and out into the garden, she was blissfully unconscious of the</Content><Content>fact. She took the volume to her own form-room and settled herself at</Content><Content>her desk with her drawing materials, cardboard, pencil, india-rubber,</Content><Content>fine pen, and a bottle of Indian ink. The little figures were exactly</Content><Content>what she wanted, quite simple in outline, but most effective, and not at</Content><Content>all difficult. They would certainly improve Lizzie's calendar for the</Content><Content>week, and relieve the sombre character of the Dryden quotations. She</Content><Content>worked away very rapidly, sketching them lightly in pencil, intending to</Content><Content>finish them in ink afterwards. She grew quite interested, especially</Content><Content>when she reached the pen part. That little face with its laughing mouth</Content><Content>and aureole of hair was really very pretty; she had copied it without</Content><Content>having to use the india-rubber once.</Content><Content>"Ulyth Stanton, what are you doing with that book?" said a voice from</Content><Content>behind her desk.</Content><Content>Beside her stood Helen Cooper and Stephanie Radford, the former hugely</Content><Content>indignant, the latter with a non-committal expression. Ulyth started so</Content><Content>violently that the bottle of Indian ink overturned and spread itself out</Content><Content>in three streams.</Content><Content>"Oh Jemima!" shrieked Ulyth in consternation.</Content><Content>"Now you've done it!" exclaimed Helen angrily. "Ink all over the page.</Content><Content>What a disgraceful mess! For goodness' sake stop; you're making it</Content><Content>worse. Give it to me."</Content><Content>Ulyth, who was frantically mopping up the black streams with her pocket</Content><Content>handkerchief, surrendered the book to the outraged librarian. Nemesis</Content><Content>had indeed descended upon her guilty head.</Content><Content>"You knew perfectly well that you weren't allowed to take it to-day,"</Content><Content>scolded Helen. "You sneaked into the library and got it while I was</Content><Content>out."</Content><Content>"Someone else has been sneaking too," thought Ulyth, with a glance at</Content><Content>Stephanie's face. "I fancy I know who turned informer." Then aloud she</Content><Content>said: "I'm fearfully sorry. I'll buy a new copy of the book."</Content><Content>"I don't believe you can; it's one Mrs. Arnold gave to the school, and</Content><Content>is published in America. I'll try sponging it with salts of lemon, but</Content><Content>I'm afraid nothing will take out the stain. I thought better of you,</Content><Content>Ulyth Stanton. One doesn't expect such things from V B. You'll borrow no</Content><Content>more books till the end of the month. Do you understand?"</Content><Content>Ulyth responded with what meekness she could muster. She admitted that</Content><Content>the monitress had reason for wrath, and that she had really no excuse</Content><Content>worthy of urging in extenuation of her crime. It was hard to be debarred</Content><Content>the use of the library for more than a fortnight, but, Helen, she knew,</Content><Content>would enforce that discipline rigidly. The unfortunate motto-cards had</Content><Content>come in for the bulk of the ink, and were completely spoilt. Ulyth</Content><Content>carried the ruins to Lizzie's bedroom and pleaded _peccavi_.</Content><Content>"Well, I suppose it can't be helped. I've done my three cards with</Content><Content>pictures of flowers, and the rest of the calendar will have to be</Content><Content>plain," said Lizzie. "You were rather an idiot, Ulyth."</Content><Content>"I know. I'd have asked Helen for the book if she'd been anywhere near,</Content><Content>and I meant to tell her afterwards that I'd taken it."</Content><Content>"Didn't you explain that to her?"</Content><Content>"No. It didn't come well when she'd just caught me."</Content><Content>"You let her think the worst of you."</Content><Content>"It couldn't be helped. I'm sure Stephanie hunted her up and told her."</Content><Content>"Stephanie doesn't like you."</Content><Content>"No, because I champion Rona, and Stephanie can't bear her."</Content><Content>"There's nothing so much wrong with the poor old Cuckoo now; she's</Content><Content>wonderfully inoffensive."</Content><Content>"Yes, but she's not aristocratic. Stephie rubs that in to her</Content><Content>continually. She calls her 'a daughter of the people'."</Content><Content>"Stephanie Radford can be uncommonly snobbish sometimes."</Content><Content>Stephanie from the very first had resented Rona's presence at The</Content><Content>Woodlands, and since the practical joke which the latter had played upon</Content><Content>her she had disliked her heartily. She lost no opportunity of showing</Content><Content>her contempt, and of trying to make Rona seem of small account. She</Content><Content>revived an ancient tradition of the school which made it a breach of</Content><Content>etiquette for girls to go into other form-rooms than their own, thus</Content><Content>banishing Rona from V B, where she had often been brought in by Ulyth or</Content><Content>good-natured Addie to share the fun that went on. If obliged to take</Content><Content>Rona's hand in figure-dancing, she would only give the extreme tips of</Content><Content>her fingers, and if forced on any occasion to sit next to her, she would</Content><Content>draw away her skirts as if she feared contamination.</Content><Content>"The Woodlands isn't what it used to be," she would assure a select</Content><Content>circle of listeners. "When my eldest sister was here there were the</Content><Content>Courtenays and the Derringtons and the Vernons and quite a number of</Content><Content>girls of really good family. Miss Bowes would never have dreamt then of</Content><Content>taking a girl she knew nothing about; she was so particular whom she</Content><Content>received."</Content><Content>"The poor old Cuckoo has her points," volunteered Addie. "I'm afraid</Content><Content>most of us aren't 'county'!"</Content><Content>"All schools are more mixed than they used to be," admitted Stephanie</Content><Content>candidly; "but I'd draw the line at specimens straight from the</Content><Content>backwoods."</Content><Content>Few of the girls really liked Stephanie, nevertheless her opinions</Content><Content>carried weight. A school-mate who dresses well, talks continually of</Content><Content>highborn friends, and "gives herself airs" can nearly always command a</Content><Content>certain following among the more unthinking of her comrades, and such</Content><Content>girls as Beth Broadway, Alice and Merle Denham, and Mary Acton were</Content><Content>easily impressed by Stephanie's attitude of superiority, and ready to</Content><Content>follow her lead on a question of caste. It gave them a kind of reflected</Content><Content>credit to belong to Stephanie's circle, and they liked to pride</Content><Content>themselves upon their exclusiveness.</Content><Content>Though Rona was many thousand miles away from her home, she evidently</Content><Content>did not forget her New Zealand friends, and looked out anxiously for the</Content><Content>thin foreign letters which arrived from time to time. She never showed</Content><Content>them to anybody, and spoke little of old associations, but a word would</Content><Content>slip out here and there to reveal that she cared more than she would</Content><Content>give her schoolfellows to suppose. One afternoon, shortly before the New</Content><Content>Zealand mail was expected, Rona was working in her portion of the</Content><Content>garden, when Mary Acton brought her a message.</Content><Content>"Some visitors to see you. They're waiting in the practising-room,"</Content><Content>announced Mary.</Content><Content>"Visitors to see me!" exclaimed Rona, throwing down her rake. "Whoever</Content><Content>can they be?"</Content><Content>"I'm sure I don't know," replied Mary stolidly. "They asked for Miss</Content><Content>Mitchell, so I suppose that's you. There isn't anyone else in the school</Content><Content>named Mitchell."</Content><Content>"It must be me!"</Content><Content>Rona's eyes were wide with excitement. Visitors for herself! It was such</Content><Content>an utter surprise. For one moment a wild idea flashed across her mind.</Content><Content>Her face suddenly hardened.</Content><Content>"What are they like? Do you know them?" she gasped.</Content><Content>"Not from Adam, or rather Eve. They're just two very ordinary-looking</Content><Content>females."</Content><Content>Much agitated, Rona flew into the house to wash her hands, slip off her</Content><Content>gardening-apron, and change her shoes. When this very hasty toilet was</Content><Content>completed, she walked to the practising-room and entered nervously. Two</Content><Content>ladies were sitting near the piano, with their backs to the window. They</Content><Content>were not fashionably dressed, but perhaps they were cold, for both wore</Content><Content>their large coat collars turned up. Their felt hats had wide floppy</Content><Content>brims. One carried a guide to North Wales, and the other held an open</Content><Content>motor-map in her hand, as if she had been studying the route.</Content><Content>"Miss Mitchell? How d'you do?" said the taller of the two as Rona</Content><Content>entered. "I dare say you'll be surprised to see us, and you won't know</Content><Content>who we are. I'm Mrs. Grant, and this is my cousin, Miss Smith. We live</Content><Content>in New Zealand, and know some of your friends there. We're visiting</Content><Content>England at present, and as we found ourselves motoring through North</Content><Content>Wales, we thought we would call and see you."</Content><Content>"It's very good of you," faltered Rona. "Which friends of mine do you</Content><Content>know?"</Content><Content>"The Higsons. They sent you all kinds of messages."</Content><Content>"Oh! How are they? Do tell me about them!"</Content><Content>Rona's cheeks were flushed and her lips quivering.</Content><Content>"Pamela has grown, of course. Connie and Minnie have had measles. Billy</Content><Content>had a fall from his horse and sprained his ankle badly, but he's all</Content><Content>right again now."</Content><Content>"And Jake?"</Content><Content>"Spends most of his time with the Johnson girls."</Content><Content>"Who are they? I never heard of them."</Content><Content>"They came after you left."</Content><Content>"To which farm?"</Content><Content>"Oh, not very far away, I believe!"</Content><Content>"I wonder Pamela didn't tell me all that in her letter. Which farm can</Content><Content>it possibly be? Surely not Heathlands?"</Content><Content>"I believe that was the name."</Content><Content>"Then have the Marstons gone?"</Content><Content>"Yes, to the North Island."</Content><Content>"Oh! I'm very sorry. Why didn't they write to me? Did you hear any other</Content><Content>news, please?"</Content><Content>"Pamela told me something about your home."</Content><Content>A shadow crossed Rona's face.</Content><Content>"Is it--is it Mrs. Barker?" she asked nervously.</Content><Content>"Yes, it's about her."</Content><Content>"What has she been doing?"</Content><Content>"Getting married again."</Content><Content>"Oh! Oh! Who would have her?"</Content><Content>"Your father."</Content><Content>"No!" shrieked Rona, her eyes ablaze. "It can't be! That dreadful,</Content><Content>drinking woman! Oh, I can't--I won't believe it!"</Content><Content>"She's your stepmother now, whether you like it or not."</Content><Content>"Daddy! Daddy! It can't be! How could you? You knew she drank!"</Content><Content>"He's drinking himself--like a fish."</Content><Content>"No! My daddy?"</Content><Content>Rona, a moment ago furious, had turned white as a ghost. She put out a</Content><Content>trembling hand and clutched the piano blindly; then, with a pitiful,</Content><Content>broken cry, she fell, half-fainting, half-sobbing, on to the floor. At</Content><Content>that moment Ulyth, with her music-case, entered the room.</Content><Content>"What's the matter? Rona! Rona, dear! Are you ill? Who are</Content><Content>these--people?"</Content><Content>She might well ask, for the behaviour of the two strangers was most</Content><Content>unprecedented. They were leaning on each other's shoulders and roaring</Content><Content>with laughter. One of them suddenly threw up her hat, and turned down</Content><Content>her collar, revealing the familiar features of Stephanie Radford.</Content><Content>"Done you brown!" she exploded. "Paid you back in your own coin for your</Content><Content>precious Eau de Venus sell! I'm even with you now, Rona Mitchell! Come</Content><Content>along, Beth." And the pair disappeared, guffawing.</Content><Content>Rona picked herself up shakily, and subsided on to a chair, with her</Content><Content>face in her hands.</Content><Content>"It's not true then?" she quavered.</Content><Content>"What isn't true?"</Content><Content>"They told me Dad had married Mrs. Barker, and that he was--drinking!"</Content><Content>"Stephanie told you that?"</Content><Content>"Yes. Oh, I'm queer still!"</Content><Content>"Rona, darling, of course it's nothing but a black, wicked lie. Don't</Content><Content>cry so. There isn't a word of truth about it. They were only ragging</Content><Content>you. Oh, don't take it so hard! I'll settle with Stephanie for this."</Content><Content>Half an hour afterwards a very grim, determined Ulyth, supported by</Content><Content>Lizzie Lonsdale, sought out the masqueraders and spoke her mind.</Content><Content>"She ragged me, so why shouldn't I turn the tables on her? It's nothing</Content><Content>to make such a hullabaloo about!" yapped Stephanie.</Content><Content>"But it is. The trick she played on you was only fun after all. Yours</Content><Content>was the cruellest thing you could think of to hurt and wound her. You</Content><Content>may pride yourself on your family, Stephanie Radford, but I'm sure the</Content><Content>very commonest person would have had nicer feelings than to do this. I</Content><Content>can never think the same of you and Beth again."</Content><Content>"Oh, of course you take up the cudgels for your precious Cuckoo!"</Content><Content>snapped Stephanie. "Don't make such an absurd fuss. I shall do what I</Content><Content>like, without you setting yourself up to lecture me. So there! If you</Content><Content>don't like it, you may lump it."</Content><Content>"Not a very aristocratic form of expression for a scion of the Radfords</Content><Content>of Stoke Radford!" commented Lizzie, as she and Ulyth stalked away.</Content><Content>CHAPTER XII</Content><Content>Sentry Duty</Content><Content>The spring term wore slowly on. March winds came and went, taking the</Content><Content>sweet violets with them, but leaving golden Lent lilies and a wealth of</Content><Content>primroses as a legacy to April. The larch forest above Porth Powys was a</Content><Content>tangle of green tassels, the hedgerows were starry with blackthorn, and</Content><Content>the _Pyrus japonica_ over the dining-room windows was a mass of rosy</Content><Content>blossom. Spring was always a delightful season at The Woodlands; with</Content><Content>the longer days came rambles and greater freedom. Popular opinion ran</Content><Content>high in extolling country life, and any girl who ventured to prefer town</Content><Content>pleasures found herself entirely in the minority.</Content><Content>Rona had several invitations for the Easter holidays, one from Mrs.</Content><Content>Stanton among the number; but Miss Bowes, thinking it better for Ulyth</Content><Content>to have a rest from her room-mate's presence, decided in favour of</Content><Content>Winnie Fowler. Ulyth could not help feeling a sense of relief that the</Content><Content>matter was thus settled. Rona was very little trouble to her</Content><Content>now--indeed, she rather liked her company; but she would be glad to have</Content><Content>her mother to herself for the few short weeks.</Content><Content>"I wouldn't for the world have tried to stop her coming, Motherkins,"</Content><Content>she wrote home; "but Miss Bowes said most emphatically that she must go</Content><Content>to the Fowlers. I'm sure they'll give her a good time, and--well, I</Content><Content>admit it will be a rest to me. Just at present I don't want to share</Content><Content>you. Now you know the whole of your horrid daughter! Lizzie asked me if</Content><Content>I would spend part of the holidays with her, but I managed to make an</Content><Content>excuse. I felt I couldn't spare a single precious day away from you. I</Content><Content>have so much to talk about and tell you. Am I greedy? But what's the use</Content><Content>of having one's own lovely mother if she isn't just one's ownest</Content><Content>sometimes? I tell you things I wouldn't tell anyone else on earth. I</Content><Content>don't think all the girls feel quite the same; but then their mothers</Content><Content>can't possibly be like mine! She's the one in a thousand! I'm sitting up</Content><Content>late in my bedroom to write this, and I shall have to report myself to</Content><Content>Miss Lodge to-morrow; but I felt I must write."</Content><Content>After the Easter holidays everybody returned to The Woodlands prepared</Content><Content>to make the most of the coming term. With the longer evenings more time</Content><Content>was allowed out-of-doors, and the glade by the stream became a kind of</Content><Content>summer parlour. Those girls who had some slight skill in carpentry</Content><Content>constructed rustic benches and tables from the boughs blown down by last</Content><Content>autumn's storms, and those who preferred nature untouched by art had</Content><Content>their favourite seats in snug corners among the bushes or on the stones</Content><Content>by the water-side. With the first burst of warm weather bathing was</Content><Content>allowed, and every morning detachments of figures in mackintoshes and</Content><Content>tennis-shoes might be seen wending their way towards the large pool to</Content><Content>indulge in the exhilarating delight of a dip in clear, flowing water,</Content><Content>followed by a brisk run round the glade. These pre-breakfast expeditions</Content><Content>were immensely appreciated; the girls willingly got up earlier for the</Content><Content>purpose, and anyone who manifested a disposition to remain in bed was</Content><Content>denounced as a "slacker".</Content><Content>One day, towards the end of May, when some of the members of V B were</Content><Content>sitting with their fancywork on the short grass under an oak-tree, Addie</Content><Content>Knighton came from the house and joined them. There was beaming</Content><Content>satisfaction in Addie's twinkling grey eyes; she rubbed her hands</Content><Content>ostentatiously, and chuckled audibly.</Content><Content>"What's to do, Addie, old girl? You're looking very smug," said Lizzie.</Content><Content>"Aha! Wouldn't you like to know? What'll you give me if I tell you now?"</Content><Content>"Never buy pigs in pokes. It mayn't be important at all," volunteered</Content><Content>Merle.</Content><Content>"Oh, indeed! Isn't it? Just wait till you hear."</Content><Content>"It's nothing but one of your sells," yawned Gertrude Oliver, moving so</Content><Content>as to rest her back more comfortably against Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Mrs. Arnold doesn't generally spring sells upon us."</Content><Content>Ulyth jumped up so suddenly that Gertrude collapsed with a squeal of</Content><Content>protest.</Content><Content>"Mrs. Arnold here and I never knew! Where is she?"</Content><Content>"Don't excite yourself. She's gone by now. She only stayed ten minutes,</Content><Content>to see Miss Bowes, but it was ten minutes to some purpose. Do you know</Content><Content>what she's actually proposed?"</Content><Content>Addie's listeners were as eager now as they had been languid before.</Content><Content>"Go ahead, can't you?" urged Lizzie.</Content><Content>"Well, the whole school's to go camping for three days."</Content><Content>This indeed was news!</Content><Content>"Stunning!"</Content><Content>"Spiffing!"</Content><Content>"Ripping!"</Content><Content>"Scrumptious!" burst in a chorus from the elated four.</Content><Content>"Details, please," added Ulyth. "When and where, and how, and why?"</Content><Content>"Is it a Camp-fire business?" asked Lizzie.</Content><Content>"Of course it is or Mrs. Arnold wouldn't be getting it up. It's happened</Content><Content>this way. The Llangarmon and Elwyn Bay detachments of Boy Scouts are to</Content><Content>camp at Llyn Gwynedd for ten days early in June. Mr. Arnold has the</Content><Content>arranging of it all. And Mrs. Arnold suggested that the tents might just</Content><Content>as easily be hired a few days sooner, and we could use them before the</Content><Content>boys came. It's such a splendid opportunity. It would be too expensive</Content><Content>to have everything sent down on purpose just for us, but when they're</Content><Content>there we can hire the camp for very little extra. It's the carriage and</Content><Content>erecting that cost so much. Miss Bowes, I believe, hummed and ha-ed a</Content><Content>little, but Teddie just tumbled to the idea and persuaded the Rainbow</Content><Content>to clinch it."</Content><Content>"Good old Teddie! I believe it's the tragedy of her life that she can't</Content><Content>live altogether in the open air. She adores Red Cross Work."</Content><Content>"The teachers are all to come to camp; they're as excited as you please</Content><Content>about it. It was Miss Lodge who told me that Mrs. Arnold was here, and I</Content><Content>rushed down the drive and caught her just for a second."</Content><Content>This indeed was an event in the annals of the school. Never since the</Content><Content>Camp-fire League was started had its members found any opportunity of</Content><Content>sampling life under canvas. They had practised a little camp cookery</Content><Content>down by the stream, but their experiments had not gone much farther than</Content><Content>frying eggs and bacon or roasting potatoes in hot ashes, and they were</Content><Content>yearning to try their hands at gipsies' stews and gallipot soups. With</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold for leader they expected a three days' elysium. Even Miss</Content><Content>Teddington, they knew, would rise to the occasion and play trumps. Llyn</Content><Content>Gwynedd was a small lonely lake about six miles away, in the heart of</Content><Content>the mountains beyond Penllwyd and Glyder Garmon. It was reached from The</Content><Content>Woodlands by a track across the moors, but it communicated by high road</Content><Content>with Capelcefn station, so that tents, camp-furniture, and provisions</Content><Content>could be sent up by a motor-lorry. The ground was hired from a local</Content><Content>farmer, who undertook to supply milk, butter, and eggs to the best of</Content><Content>his ability, and to bring meat and fresh vegetables from Capelcefn as</Content><Content>required. To cater for a whole school up in the wilds is a task from</Content><Content>which many Principals would shrink, and Miss Bowes might be forgiven if</Content><Content>she had at first demurred at the suggestion. But, with Mr. Arnold's</Content><Content>practical experience to help her, she gave her orders and embarked (not</Content><Content>without a few tremors) upon the proceeding.</Content><Content>"If the mountain air makes you so hungry you eat up two days' provisions</Content><Content>in one, it means you'll have to fast on the third day," she assured the</Content><Content>girls. "I'm sending up what I hope will be sufficient. It's like</Content><Content>victualling a regiment. Of course we shan't go at all if it's wet."</Content><Content>Mr. Arnold, who very kindly volunteered to see that the camp was</Content><Content>properly set up and in thorough working order before the school took</Content><Content>possession, superintended the erection of the tents and reported that</Content><Content>all was in apple-pie condition and only waiting for its battalion. On</Content><Content>2nd June, therefore, a very jolly procession started off from The</Content><Content>Woodlands. In navy skirts and sports coats, tricolor ties, straw hats,</Content><Content>and decorated with numerous badges and small flags, the girls felt like</Content><Content>a regiment of female Territorials. Each carried her kit on her back in a</Content><Content>home-made knapsack containing her few personal necessities, and knife,</Content><Content>spoon, fork, and enamelled tin mug. A band of tin whistles and mouth</Content><Content>organs led the way, playing a valiant attempt at "Caller Herrin'". The</Content><Content>teachers also were prepared for business. Miss Teddington, who had done</Content><Content>climbs in Switzerland, came in orthodox costume with nailed boots and a</Content><Content>jaunty Tyrolean hat with a piece of edelweiss stuck in the front. Miss</Content><Content>Lodge wore a full-length leather coat and felt hat in which she looked</Content><Content>ready to defy a waterspout or a tornado. Miss Moseley, who owned to an</Content><Content>ever-present terror of bulls, grasped an iron-spiked walking-stick, and</Content><Content>Miss Davis had a First Aid wallet slung across her back. In the girls'</Content><Content>opinion Miss Bowes shirked abominably. Instead of venturing on the</Content><Content>six-mile walk she had caught the morning train to Capelcefn, and was</Content><Content>going to hire a car at the Royal Hotel and drive up to the lake with the</Content><Content>provisions. Mrs. Arnold, who, with her husband, had taken rooms at the</Content><Content>farm for a few days, was already on the spot, and would be ready to</Content><Content>receive the travellers when they arrived.</Content><Content>On the whole it was a glorious morning, though a few ill-omened clouds</Content><Content>lingered like a night-cap round Penllwyd. Larks were singing, cuckoos</Content><Content>calling, bluebells made the woods seem a reflection of the sky, and the</Content><Content>gorse was ablaze on the common. The walk was collar-work at first, up,</Content><Content>up, up, climbing a steep track between loose-built, fern-covered walls,</Content><Content>taking a short cut over the slope that formed the spur of Cwm Dinas, and</Content><Content>scaling the rocky little precipice of Maenceirion. Some who had started</Content><Content>at a great rate and with much enthusiasm began to slacken speed, and to</Content><Content>realize the wisdom of Miss Teddington's advice and try the slow-going,</Content><Content>steady pace she had learned from Swiss guides.</Content><Content>"You can't keep it up if you begin with such a spurt," she assured them.</Content><Content>"Alpine climbing has to be like the tortoise--slow and sure."</Content><Content>Once on the plateau beyond Cwm Dinas progress was easier. It was still</Content><Content>uphill, but the slope was gentler. They were on the open moors now,</Content><Content>following a path, little more than a sheep track, that led under the</Content><Content>crag of Glyder Garmon. Except for an occasional tiny whitewashed farm</Content><Content>they were far from human habitations, and the only signs of life were</Content><Content>the small agile Welsh sheep, the half-wild ponies that grazed on these</Content><Content>uplands during the summer months, and a pair of carrion crows that</Content><Content>wheeled away, croaking hoarsely at the sight of intruders. On and on</Content><Content>over what seemed an interminable reach of coarse grass and</Content><Content>whinberry-bushes, jumping tiny brooks, and skirting round sometimes to</Content><Content>avoid bogs, for much of the ground was spongy, and though its surface of</Content><Content>sphagnum moss looked inviting, it was treacherous in the extreme. At</Content><Content>last they had rounded the corner of Glyder Garmon, and there, far away</Content><Content>to the right, like a sheet of silver, Llyn Gwynedd lay gleaming in the</Content><Content>distance.</Content><Content>The sight of their destination, even though it was two miles away,</Content><Content>cheered up those weaker spirits that were beginning to lag, especially</Content><Content>as something white on the south side, when examined through Miss</Content><Content>Teddington's field-glasses, proved to be the tents. Three-quarters of an</Content><Content>hour's brisk walking brought them to the lake, and in ten minutes more</Content><Content>they were announcing their approach to the camp in a succession of wild</Content><Content>hoorays.</Content><Content>Mr. and Mrs. Arnold were waiting to do the honours, and, parading in</Content><Content>their very best style, the League marched in and took possession.</Content><Content>By the time they had been two hours at Llyn Gwynedd all the girls felt</Content><Content>like old, well-seasoned campers. Mrs. Arnold was no novice, and at once</Content><Content>assumed her post as leader and captain in command. Miss Bowes, Miss</Content><Content>Teddington, and the other teachers were assigned tents of honour, and</Content><Content>every member of the League was placed on definite duty. Some were cooks,</Content><Content>some water-carriers, some scullions, and some sentries, according to</Content><Content>their qualifications and the rank they held in the League.</Content><Content>The field hired for the camping-ground had been carefully chosen. It was</Content><Content>on the far side of the lake, away from the road, sheltered on the north</Content><Content>and east by mountain ridges, and with a shelving beach of fine silvery</Content><Content>sand where the waves lapped in gentle little ripples. A narrow brook,</Content><Content>leaping from the heights above, passed through the centre and gave a</Content><Content>quite uncontaminated water supply. All around rose peaks which had not</Content><Content>been visible at The Woodlands, the rough, splintered crest of Craig</Content><Content>Mawr, the smoother summit of Pencastell, and the almost inaccessible</Content><Content>precipice of Carnedd Powys. It was glorious to sit by the lake and feel</Content><Content>that they were not obliged to return to school before dark, but could</Content><Content>stay and watch the sun set behind Pencastell and the gloaming creep</Content><Content>quietly on. Of course everybody wanted to explore the immediate</Content><Content>vicinity, and little bands, each in charge of a Torch-bearer, were</Content><Content>allowed to skirt round the lake within sight of the camp. Each girl had</Content><Content>her League whistle, and knew the signals which meant "Meal-time",</Content><Content>"Danger", and "Return instantly to camp". These had been rehearsed in</Content><Content>the glade at The Woodlands, and formed part of the examination of every</Content><Content>candidate.</Content><Content>Ulyth, as a Torch-bearer, was able to head a party, and started off in</Content><Content>quest of bog myrtle along the bank, returning with great armfuls of the</Content><Content>delicious-smelling aromatic shrub to cast into the fire during the</Content><Content>evening "stunt".</Content><Content>The gathering of the League that night was a memorable occasion. The</Content><Content>ceremonies were observed with strictest formality, and as visitors were</Content><Content>present a special welcome song was sung in their honour. The scene was</Content><Content>immensely picturesque and romantic: the red sun setting between Craig</Content><Content>Mawr and Pencastell threw a last glow on the lake, the blazing fire</Content><Content>lighted up the camp and the rows of eager faces, and behind all was the</Content><Content>background of the eternal hills.</Content><Content>Rona, having successfully passed through her probation, was admitted as</Content><Content>a Wood-gatherer and awarded the white badge of service. Several younger</Content><Content>girls also received initiation into membership. With the League</Content><Content>ceremonial, songs, stories, and cocoa-making, the evening passed very</Content><Content>swiftly away. At nine o'clock everybody was expected to turn in. A night</Content><Content>under canvas was a new experience. The stretcher-beds and the clean</Content><Content>blankets looked inviting. Strict military discipline was observed in the</Content><Content>camp, and sentries were told off on duty. In as perfect order as a</Content><Content>regiment the girls went to their tents. Ulyth was sharing quarters with</Content><Content>Addie, Lizzie, and Gertrude. She tucked herself up in her blankets, as</Content><Content>she had been taught at camp drill, and then lay quietly for a long,</Content><Content>long time, watching the patch of sky through the tent door.</Content><Content>She seemed only to have been asleep for about an hour, when the patrol</Content><Content>touched her on the shoulder. Instantly she sprang up, broad awake.</Content><Content>"Relieve sentry at west guard," was the order, and the patrol passed on.</Content><Content>It was too dark to see her watch, but Ulyth knew it must be nearly one</Content><Content>o'clock. She hastily donned the warm garments ordered to be worn by</Content><Content>sentries, and hurried away to relieve Helen Cooper. Her post was at the</Content><Content>west end of the camp, where the field merged into a rushy swamp before</Content><Content>it rose into the hill that led towards the farm.</Content><Content>"The password is 'Louvain'," said Helen, retiring, not at all sorry to</Content><Content>seek the comfort of her bed. "One leg of the camp-stool is most rickety,</Content><Content>so I warn you not to lean too hard on it. Good night."</Content><Content>Left alone, Ulyth sat down with extreme caution on the deficient</Content><Content>camp-stool and surveyed the situation. There were clouds across a waning</Content><Content>moon, and it was fairly dark. She could see the outlines of the tents in</Content><Content>black masses behind her; in front the field lay dim and shadowy, with a</Content><Content>mist creeping from the water. Up above, to her right, against an indigo</Content><Content>sky, the Great Bear was standing almost on its head, with its tail in</Content><Content>the air. One of the tests of a Torch-bearer was a knowledge of the</Content><Content>stars, and Ulyth had learnt how to tell the time by the position of this</Content><Content>particular constellation. She made a rapid calculation now, reckoning</Content><Content>from the day of the month, and was glad to find it came out correctly.</Content><Content>Cassiopeia's white arms were hidden by the mountains, but the Milky Way</Content><Content>shimmered in the east, and overhead Arcturus blazed as he had done in</Content><Content>the days when the patriarch Job recorded his brilliance. To the extreme</Content><Content>north a patch of light lay behind Penllwyd, where the sun, at this</Content><Content>season hardly dipping far out of sight, worked his course round to the</Content><Content>east again. How quiet it was! The silence was almost oppressive. The</Content><Content>gentle lap of the tiny waves on the lake was not equal to the rush of</Content><Content>the stream at The Woodlands. Not even a night-bird called. The camp was</Content><Content>absolutely still and slumbering.</Content><Content>Ulyth rose and paced about for a while. It was too cold to sit still</Content><Content>long. She must only use the camp-stool when she needed a rest.</Content><Content>"Sentries ought to be allowed chocolates," she murmured, "or hot</Content><Content>peppermints, just to keep up their spirits. Ugh! How weird and eerie it</Content><Content>all is! There isn't a sound anywhere. It's not an enlivening performance</Content><Content>to keep watch, I must say."</Content><Content>She stopped, suddenly on the alert. What was that noise in the darkness</Content><Content>to her left? She distinctly heard a rustle among the gorse-bushes, and</Content><Content>thought something moved in the deep shadow.</Content><Content>"Halt! Who goes there?" she challenged.</Content><Content>There was no reply, but the rustle sounded again, this time nearer to</Content><Content>the camp. She listened with every sense strained to the uttermost.</Content><Content>Something or someone was slinking in from the field and creeping</Content><Content>cautiously towards the tents; of that she was nearly certain. Wild ideas</Content><Content>of thieving tramps flooded her brain. A louder sound confirmed her</Content><Content>suspicions. She could hear it quite distinctly in the direction of the</Content><Content>kitchen. Her duty was plain. She blew her whistle promptly; it was</Content><Content>answered by those of the three other sentries, from the north, east, and</Content><Content>south quarters, and immediately torches began to flash, and voices to</Content><Content>ask the cause of alarm. The guard was roused, and began an instant tour</Content><Content>of inspection.</Content><Content>"Something crept past me, straight towards the centre of the camp,"</Content><Content>Ulyth reported.</Content><Content>The lights flashed away in the direction of the kitchen. The girls were</Content><Content>on their mettle, and meant business. Whoever the intruder was, he should</Content><Content>be run to earth and made to give an account of himself. They felt</Content><Content>perfectly capable of taking him prisoner and binding his hands behind</Content><Content>him with a rope. Indeed, they thought they should hugely enjoy doing so,</Content><Content>particularly if he turned out to be a burglar. Numbers give courage, and</Content><Content>a very martial spirit was in the air.</Content><Content>"If he's hiding in one of the tents we'll drag him out by the legs!"</Content><Content>proclaimed Marjorie Earnshaw fiercely.</Content><Content>Everybody was sure it must be a "he". The news spread through the camp</Content><Content>like lightning, and it was even rumoured that he wore a coat and</Content><Content>top-boots. Miss Teddington herself had emerged, and was waving a lantern</Content><Content>as a searchlight.</Content><Content>"This way," blustered Marjorie, heading for the kitchen quarter. "The</Content><Content>sneaking cur! We'll have him!"</Content><Content>"Why aren't we allowed bayonets?" lamented Ruth White.</Content><Content>"Oh, I hear a noise! There's something there really," urged Kathleen</Content><Content>Simpson, with a most unsoldierly squeal. "Oh, I say! Here he comes!"</Content><Content>There was a sudden scratch and scramble, and from out the larder rushed</Content><Content>a dark object on four legs, with a white something in its mouth. Helen</Content><Content>made a valiant dash at it, but it dodged her, and flew like the wind</Content><Content>away between the tents and off somewhere over the fields in the</Content><Content>direction of the farm. The guard with one accord burst out laughing.</Content><Content>"A thieving Welsh sheep-dog raiding the larder!" exclaimed Catherine.</Content><Content>"It's stolen a whole leg of mutton, the brute!" wailed Doris, who</Content><Content>belonged to the Commissariat Department. "I didn't think it could have</Content><Content>reached that. It must have jumped high. It doesn't deserve its prize."</Content><Content>"No wonder it wouldn't answer when I challenged it," observed Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Well, I'm glad it's no worse than a dog," said Miss Teddington. "We</Content><Content>must take steps to-morrow to make the larder safer, or we shall be</Content><Content>troubled again."</Content><Content>"We'll place a guard over it," replied Catherine promptly. "Jessie</Content><Content>Morrison, you are on sentry duty at once to watch the larder. Maggie</Content><Content>Orton will relieve you at three."</Content><Content>CHAPTER XIII</Content><Content>Under Canvas</Content><Content>After the scare in the small hours, everyone settled down again to</Content><Content>slumber. Nevertheless the girls woke with the birds. Many of them had</Content><Content>registered a solemn vow the night before that they would watch the sun</Content><Content>rise, and each was pledged to arouse the others at all costs; so at the</Content><Content>first hint of dawn heads began to pop out of tents, and the camp was</Content><Content>astir. Addie Knighton, still half-dazed with sleep, was led firmly by</Content><Content>Gertrude Oliver to the edge of the lake and forced to wash her face.</Content><Content>"You'll thank me when you're really awake," purred Gertie, ignoring her</Content><Content>victim's protests. "It's only what I promised you faithfully last night.</Content><Content>You told me to duck you in, if nothing else would do it."</Content><Content>"Oh, I'm awake now! I am truly. You needn't be afraid I'll go back to</Content><Content>bed," bleated Addie, afraid her friend might proceed to extremities.</Content><Content>"Hadn't you better haul up Alice next?"</Content><Content>"I left Chrissie doing that. She's going round the tents with a wet</Content><Content>sponge. Look! Isn't that worth getting up to see?"</Content><Content>The grey of the sky had flushed into carnation pink, and up from behind</Content><Content>the wall of the mountains rose the great ball of the sun, red at first</Content><Content>through a veil of mist, but shining out golden as he cleared the</Content><Content>cloud-bank. Everything was waking up. A peewit called by the water's</Content><Content>edge, a cock crew from the farm-yard, and a dog barked lustily.</Content><Content>"Our thief of the night complaining of an attack of indigestion, I</Content><Content>hope," said Ulyth, joining Addie and Gertie at the lake-side. "How much</Content><Content>can a dog eat without feeling ill?"</Content><Content>"We had a collie that consumed three rabbits once," laughed Addie. "We</Content><Content>didn't ask it how it felt afterwards. It got a good thrashing, I</Content><Content>remember."</Content><Content>"We'll keep a stick handy to-night, in case of any more raids. Who's on</Content><Content>breakfast duty? I'm getting wildly hungry. I hope the bacon hasn't</Content><Content>disappeared with the mutton."</Content><Content>Although the three days' sojourn under canvas was in a sense a holiday,</Content><Content>it was conducted in a very business-like spirit and with rigid</Content><Content>discipline. All the daily duties were performed zealously by bands of</Content><Content>servers, who polished tins, peeled potatoes, washed plates, or cleaned</Content><Content>shoes, as the case might be. The League was putting to a practical proof</Content><Content>the seven rules of the Camp-fire Law. Beauty was all around them, and</Content><Content>knowledge to be had for the asking. They proved themselves trustworthy</Content><Content>by their service, and glorified work in the doing of the camp tasks.</Content><Content>Health was drawn with every breath of mountain air, and, judging from</Content><Content>their faces, the seventh rule, "Be happy", seemed almost superfluous.</Content><Content>Everyone looked radiant, even Mary Acton, who was a champion grumbler,</Content><Content>and generally ready to complain of crumpled rose-leaves. After breakfast</Content><Content>and service duty came drill, a more than usually formal affair, for Mr.</Content><Content>Arnold himself reviewed them. He had great experience with the Boy</Content><Content>Scouts, so the girls were anxious to do the utmost credit to their</Content><Content>beloved Guardian of the Fire. The Ambulance Corps gave a demonstration</Content><Content>of First Aid; another detachment took down and re-erected a tent; the</Content><Content>juniors showed their abilities in knot-tying, and the seniors in</Content><Content>signalling. Their inspector declared himself perfectly satisfied, and</Content><Content>commended certain members for special proficiency.</Content><Content>"I shall tell the boys' battalions how well you can do," he declared.</Content><Content>"It will put them on their mettle. They won't want to be beaten by a</Content><Content>ladies' school."</Content><Content>When the display was over, all dispersed for a ramble round the lake</Content><Content>while the dinner stewed; only the cooks on duty remained, carefully</Content><Content>watching their pots. Ulyth, Rona, Lizzie, and Gertrude wandered past the</Content><Content>farm and up the hill-side to the head of a crag, whence they had a</Content><Content>glorious view down over the sheet of water below.</Content><Content>"Llyn Gwynedd looks so cheerful and innocent now, one wouldn't believe</Content><Content>it could ever be treacherous and do dreadful things," remarked Gertrude.</Content><Content>"What things?" asked Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Why, I believe someone was drowned just down there a great many years</Content><Content>ago. I heard Catherine saying so last night, so I suppose it's true."</Content><Content>"It's perfectly true, and I can tell you who it was," answered Lizzie.</Content><Content>"It was the eldest son of Lord Glyncraig. He was fishing here, and the</Content><Content>boat got upset. It was the most dreadful tragedy. He was such a fine,</Content><Content>promising young fellow, and had only been married quite a short time. He</Content><Content>was the heir, too, which made it worse."</Content><Content>"But there are other sons, aren't there?" asked Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Yes, but he was the flower of the family. The rest are no good. The</Content><Content>second son, the present heir, is a helpless invalid, the third is in a</Content><Content>sanatorium for consumption, and the fourth was the proverbial prodigal,</Content><Content>and disappeared. If Lord Glyncraig knows where he is, nobody else does."</Content><Content>"Hadn't the one who was drowned any children?"</Content><Content>"Only a girl. The second and third aren't married."</Content><Content>"Then will the estate have to go to the prodigal in the end?"</Content><Content>"I suppose so, if he's alive, and turns up to claim it."</Content><Content>"Peers have their troubles as much as commoners," commented Ulyth. "I've</Content><Content>never heard this before. I'm sorry for Lord Glyncraig. Plas Cafn is too</Content><Content>good to go to a prodigal."</Content><Content>"Yet prodigals sometimes turn out better than elder brothers, if we</Content><Content>accept the parable," remarked Rona, throwing stones into the water as</Content><Content>viciously as if she were aiming at an enemy.</Content><Content>"Don't!" said Ulyth. "You'll disturb the trout, and Mrs. Arnold wants to</Content><Content>fish this afternoon. Rona, do stop! Let's go down to the edge again, and</Content><Content>try and find some bog bean. You'll get a proficiency badge if you can</Content><Content>show twenty specimens of wild flowers and name them. Yes, I won mine</Content><Content>last year, and so did Lizzie."</Content><Content>"I'd rather win a proficiency badge for shooting," grunted Rona. "Why</Content><Content>can't Teddie let us get up a ladies' rifle corps?"</Content><Content>"Only wish she would, just! It would be prime," agreed the others.</Content><Content>Dinner was ready by twelve o'clock--not at all too early for a company</Content><Content>that had breakfasted at seven. Despite the purloining of the leg of</Content><Content>mutton there was enough to go round, and everybody decided that the</Content><Content>cooks deserved proficiency badges. The servers also did their work</Content><Content>promptly, and removed plates and dishes with the maximum of speed and</Content><Content>the minimum of clatter. By half-past one everything was washed up and</Content><Content>polished, and the kitchen department in apple-pie order.</Content><Content>"I'm afraid we may have rain," said Miss Teddington, looking anxiously</Content><Content>at the sky, which was now completely overcast with clouds.</Content><Content>"One often gets a shower among the mountains when the valley escapes,"</Content><Content>commented Mrs. Arnold. "I don't think it will be much this afternoon, if</Content><Content>there's rain at all. The patrols know what to do if it begins. This grey</Content><Content>sky will be good for fishing."</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold was an enthusiastic angler, and had brought her</Content><Content>fishing-tackle with her to camp. She intended that afternoon to hire a</Content><Content>boat from the farm and see if she could beguile some of the wily trout</Content><Content>from the lake.</Content><Content>"I'll take four girls with me," she announced: "two to row, one to</Content><Content>steer, and one to help with the landing-net."</Content><Content>Needless to say, she could have had dozens of volunteers, but her choice</Content><Content>fell on Kathleen Simpson, Ruth White, Gladys Broughton, and Evie</Content><Content>Isherwood, who, highly elated, went off to unmoor the boat. Then, Ruth</Content><Content>and Kathleen rowing, and Gladys steering, they made gently down the lake</Content><Content>towards the west end, where the stream flowed out.</Content><Content>Pretty Mrs. Arnold looked particularly charming in a blue-and-white</Content><Content>boating-costume, with a little blue fisherman's cap perched on her fair</Content><Content>hair. It was the fashion for the girls to adore her, and she certainly</Content><Content>had four whole-hearted admirers with her that afternoon, ready to be at</Content><Content>her beck and call, and to perform any service she wished. They followed</Content><Content>her instructions to the letter, and watched her line and reel with tense</Content><Content>eagerness.</Content><Content>"I hope we may catch some salmon trout," said Mrs. Arnold; "they're much</Content><Content>more delicate than the ordinary ones. If we've luck we may get enough at</Content><Content>any rate to give Miss Bowes and Miss Teddington a dish for supper. Row</Content><Content>gently along there, I saw a fish jump; if it's hungry it may fancy my</Content><Content>fly. Good biz! there's a bite. I'll have to play him gently; he feels a</Content><Content>strong fellow. Are you ready, Evie, with the landing-net?"</Content><Content>It was frightfully exciting as Mrs. Arnold wound her reel, and the prey</Content><Content>came within reach. Was he really hooked, or would he break away at the</Content><Content>last moment and disappoint them?</Content><Content>"We've got him! We've got him! Quick, Evie! Oh, I say! Isn't he</Content><Content>splendid?"</Content><Content>A silvery-grey, gleaming, glittering object was leaping in the</Content><Content>landing-net at the bottom of the boat.</Content><Content>"Oh, what luck!" yelled Evie.</Content><Content>"He must be a patriarch!" cried the rowers.</Content><Content>"I can't see him. Oh, do let me look!" squealed Gladys, forgetting</Content><Content>everything in her eagerness. "Ruth, you're in the way. I must look."</Content><Content>And up she sprang, trying to push past Ruth and Kathleen.</Content><Content>"Sit still!" shouted Mrs. Arnold frantically, but the mischief was done.</Content><Content>It all happened in two seconds. No one quite knew how, though Ruth</Content><Content>declared afterwards that in trying to scramble past her Gladys stepped</Content><Content>on the gunwale. Over toppled the boat, and almost before its occupants</Content><Content>knew their danger they were struggling in the water. The girls could</Content><Content>swim a little--a very little. Kathleen, gasping and spluttering,</Content><Content>struggled valiantly towards the bank; Evie, with a certain instinct of</Content><Content>self-preservation, turned on her back, and managed to keep herself</Content><Content>afloat somehow. Ruth and Gladys clutched the upturned boat and, clung</Content><Content>there screaming. Mrs. Arnold was in even more desperate straits. She</Content><Content>could not swim, and she had fallen too wide of the boat to be able to</Content><Content>grasp it. The few patrols left in charge of the camp stood for a moment</Content><Content>paralysed, then tore along the side of the lake towards the scene of the</Content><Content>accident. But someone else was quicker. Rona, hunting for botany</Content><Content>specimens, had been watching the fishing from the bank close by. There</Content><Content>was a rush, a splash, a swift little figure wildly ploughing a path</Content><Content>through the lake, beating the water with short, impatient strokes.</Content><Content>"I won't clutch you," cried Mrs. Arnold, pluckily keeping her presence</Content><Content>of mind. "I believe I can manage to float."</Content><Content>She lay still as Rona put a hand under her shoulder and towed her</Content><Content>towards the shore, so still that she neither stirred nor spoke when</Content><Content>Doris and Catherine, who had reached the spot, helped to drag her from</Content><Content>the water.</Content><Content>"Oh, she's drowned!" shrieked Doris.</Content><Content>"No, no! Lay her down flat. She's opening her eyes."</Content><Content>Marion Harper and Madge Johnson, both tolerable swimmers, were plunging</Content><Content>to help Evie; Kathleen was already struggling ashore. "Wait till we can</Content><Content>come for you!" shouted Rona to Ruth and Gladys; "don't let go the boat."</Content><Content>Evie was pulled ashore first, not much the worse. Rona had trouble with</Content><Content>Gladys, who had waxed hysterical, but with Marion's help she landed her</Content><Content>safely and went back for Ruth. By this time the danger-signal, blown</Content><Content>lustily from several League whistles, brought all who were anywhere</Content><Content>within reach rushing to the rendezvous. Mrs. Arnold, with wet golden</Content><Content>hair clinging round her white face, leaned against Catherine's shoulder,</Content><Content>while Doris rubbed her hands.</Content><Content>"I'm glad my husband's gone to Capel Garmon to-day. Please let me tell</Content><Content>him myself," were her first words. "It was good little Rona who saved</Content><Content>me," she added, smiling faintly at Miss Bowes, who was down on her knees</Content><Content>beside her on the grass.</Content><Content>"I wish I'd done it. I wish I'd done it. Oh, how I envy you, Rona!"</Content><Content>cried Ulyth, regarding her friend with wide shining eyes of admiration.</Content><Content>Miss Teddington, pale but very self-controlled, had taken command of the</Content><Content>situation. Eight people were thoroughly wet through and bedraggled, and</Content><Content>must be hurried to camp and dried, and given hot drinks as speedily as</Content><Content>possible. The rescuers needed cosseting as much as the rescued. Madge</Content><Content>and Marion were shivering and trembling, and Rona, now the excitement of</Content><Content>her sudden dash was over, looked more shaky than she would allow.</Content><Content>"We must tuck them up in blankets," said Miss Teddington. "First Aid</Content><Content>Corps on duty, please! The difficulty is going to be how to get their</Content><Content>clothes properly dried in a place like this."</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold, with Miss Bowes to look after her, went to the farm to seek</Content><Content>fresh garments. As for the girls, there was nothing for it but to go to</Content><Content>bed for an hour or two, while a band of servers lighted a good fire,</Content><Content>wrung the water from the drenched articles of clothing, and held them</Content><Content>to the blaze. Blankets were commandeered freely from other beds, and</Content><Content>piled round the seven heroines, who, propped up with pillows, each had a</Content><Content>kind of reception as she sipped her hot cocoa.</Content><Content>"We all of us forgot about the boat," said Rona suddenly. "It's drifting</Content><Content>upside down, and the oars are anywhere."</Content><Content>"Never mind. David Lewis will get it somehow, I suppose. It will drift</Content><Content>towards the bank, and he'll wade for it."</Content><Content>"Where did you learn to swim like that, Rona?"</Content><Content>"In the lake at home. We had one nearly as big as this close to our</Content><Content>farm."</Content><Content>"The Cuckoo's turned up trumps," murmured Alice Denham. "I didn't know</Content><Content>she was capable of it."</Content><Content>"Then it only shows how extremely stupid and unobservant you are,"</Content><Content>snapped Ulyth.</Content><Content>The servers declared afterwards that drying clothes round a bonfire was</Content><Content>the most exciting duty they had ever performed. Gusts of wind blew the</Content><Content>flames in sudden puffs, necessitating quick snatching away of garments</Content><Content>in the danger zone. Shoes were the most difficult of all, and needed</Content><Content>copious greasing to prevent their growing stiff.</Content><Content>"I wonder if the Ancient Britons went through this performance?" said</Content><Content>Winnie Fowler. "Did they have to hold their skin garments round</Content><Content>camp-fires? Thank goodness, we've got these things dry at last! We're</Content><Content>only in the nick of time. Here comes the rain."</Content><Content>It was a melancholy truth. The Welsh mountains have a perverse habit of</Content><Content>attracting clouds, even in June; the sky, which had been overcast since</Content><Content>midday, was now inky dark, and great drops began to fall. It was a</Content><Content>calamity, but one for which everybody was fully prepared. The patrols</Content><Content>rushed round the camp loosening ropes, lest the swelling hemp should</Content><Content>draw the pegs from the ground, and took a last tour of inspection to see</Content><Content>that no bed was in contact with the canvas.</Content><Content>"If you even touch the inside of the tent with your hand you'll bring</Content><Content>the water through," urged Catherine in solemn warning; "so, for your own</Content><Content>sakes, you'd best be careful. You don't want to spend the night in a</Content><Content>puddle."</Content><Content>It was a new experience to sit inside tents while the storm howled</Content><Content>outside. Rain up at Llyn Gwynedd was no mere summer shower, but a</Content><Content>driving deluge. Servers in waterproofs scuttled round with cans of hot</Content><Content>tea and baskets of bread and butter, and the girls had a picnic meal</Content><Content>sitting on their beds. One tent blew over altogether, and its distressed</Content><Content>occupants, crawling from under the flapping ruin, were received as</Content><Content>refugees by their immediate neighbours. Fortunately the storm, though</Content><Content>severe, was short. By seven o'clock it had expended its fury, and passed</Content><Content>away down the valley towards Craigwen, leaving blue sky and the promise</Content><Content>of a sunset behind. Glad to emerge from their cramped quarters, the</Content><Content>girls came out and compared experiences. There was plenty to be done.</Content><Content>The fallen tent had to be erected, and various cans and utensils which</Content><Content>had been left outside must be collected and wiped before they had time</Content><Content>to rust.</Content><Content>"This is the prose of camp-life," said Catherine, picking the</Content><Content>gravy-strainer out of a puddle and rinsing it in the lake. "I hope we</Content><Content>shall get the poetry to-morrow again."</Content><Content>"Oh, it's lovely fun when it rains!" twittered some of the younger ones.</Content><Content>Mr. Arnold came down from the farm to inquire rather anxiously how the</Content><Content>camp was faring after the storm, and particularly to have news of the</Content><Content>girls who had been in the lake. He had left Mrs. Arnold in bed, still</Content><Content>rather upset with the shock of the accident.</Content><Content>"I feel responsible for bringing you all here," he said to Miss</Content><Content>Teddington. "I shan't be easy in my mind now till the whole crew's safe</Content><Content>back at The Woodlands."</Content><Content>"We've taken no harm," Miss Teddington assured him. "The girls kept dry,</Content><Content>and they're as jolly as possible; indeed, I think most of them</Content><Content>thoroughly enjoyed the rain."</Content><Content>Llyn Gwynedd, after showing what it could do in the way of storms,</Content><Content>provided fine weather for the next day. The ground soon dried, and</Content><Content>camp-life continued in full swing. Mrs. Arnold, herself again after a</Content><Content>night's rest, took the morning drill, and led a ramble up the slope of</Content><Content>Glyder Garmon in the afternoon. She was the heart and soul of the</Content><Content>"stunt" that evening.</Content><Content>The girls, at any rate, were sorry to say good-bye to the lake on</Content><Content>Friday morning, whatever their elders might feel on the subject.</Content><Content>"I hope the Boy Scouts will have as ripping a time as we've had," was</Content><Content>the general verdict when, having left the camp in perfect order, the</Content><Content>procession set out to tramp down to Aberglyn.</Content><Content>"Barring total immersions in the lake, please," said Mr. Arnold, as he</Content><Content>returned the parting salute.</Content><Content>"But that was an opportunity," urged Ulyth. "I wish it had come my way.</Content><Content>Rona, Madge, and Marion will all get special bravery medals at next</Content><Content>quarterly meeting. I've no luck!"</Content><Content>CHAPTER XIV</Content><Content>Susannah Maude</Content><Content>The girls at The Woodlands, while they contributed to various charities,</Content><Content>had one special and particular object of interest. For several years</Content><Content>they had supported a little girl at an orphanage. She was called their</Content><Content>orphan, and twice a year they received accounts of her progress. They</Content><Content>sent her a Christmas present annually, and her neat little letter of</Content><Content>thanks was handed round for everybody to read. Poor Susannah Maude was</Content><Content>the daughter of very disreputable parents; she had been rescued from a</Content><Content>travelling caravan at the age of ten, and the authorities at the</Content><Content>Alexandra Home had done their best to obliterate her past life from her</Content><Content>memory. When she reached school-leaving age the question of her future</Content><Content>career loomed on the horizon. After considerable correspondence with the</Content><Content>matron, Miss Bowes had at length decided to have the girl at The</Content><Content>Woodlands, and try the experiment of training her as a kitchen-maid. So</Content><Content>in February Susannah Maude had arrived, small and undersized, with a</Content><Content>sharp little face and beady, black eyes, and a habit of sniffing as if</Content><Content>she had a perpetual cold.</Content><Content>"Not a bit like the blue-eyed, flaxen-haired orphan of fiction," decided</Content><Content>the girls, rather disappointed at the sight of their protégée.</Content><Content>Perhaps the cook was disappointed too. At any rate, many complaints of</Content><Content>smashed dishes, imperfect wiping, and inadequate sweeping of corners</Content><Content>reached Miss Bowes, who urged patience, harangued the culprit, and shook</Content><Content>her head, half laughing and half sighing, over the domestic</Content><Content>catastrophes. Though strictly confined to the kitchen regions, the</Content><Content>orphan took the deepest interest in the young ladies of the school. Her</Content><Content>keen eyes would peer out of windows, and her head bob round doors in</Content><Content>continual efforts to gain some idea of their mode of life. A chance word</Content><Content>from one of them wreathed her in smiles. She was a funny, odd little</Content><Content>object with her short squat figure and round bullet head, and thin</Content><Content>little legs appearing underneath her official white apron. Her official</Content><Content>name was Susan, but every girl in the school called her Susannah Maude.</Content><Content>At the instigation of Miss Bowes her patrons took the furthering of her</Content><Content>education in hand, and each in turn bestowed half an hour a day in</Content><Content>hearing her read history, geography, or some other suitable subject. A</Content><Content>little bewildered among so many fresh teachers, the small maid</Content><Content>nevertheless made what efforts she could, and read loud and lustily,</Content><Content>even if she did not altogether digest the matter she was supposed to be</Content><Content>studying.</Content><Content>"I believe she reads the words without taking in a scrap of the sense,"</Content><Content>laughed Ulyth, when her turn as instructress was over. "She was gazing</Content><Content>at my dress, or my watch, or my handkerchief whenever she could spare an</Content><Content>eye from her book. She thinks them of far more importance than Henry</Content><Content>VIII."</Content><Content>"So she does," agreed Lizzie. "I tried to get her interested yesterday</Content><Content>in the number of his wives--I thought the Bluebeard aspect of it might</Content><Content>move her--but she only said: 'What does it matter when they're all</Content><Content>dead?' I felt so blank that I couldn't say any more."</Content><Content>Nobody quite remembered whose idea it was that their orphan should be</Content><Content>invited to the Camp-fire meetings. Somebody in a soft-hearted moment</Content><Content>suggested it, and Mrs. Arnold replied: "Oh yes, poor little soul! Bring</Content><Content>her, by all means." So Susannah Maude had come, and once there she</Content><Content>apparently regarded herself as a member of the League, and turned up on</Content><Content>every available occasion. How much she understood of the proceedings or</Content><Content>of the scope of the society nobody could fathom. She sat, during the</Content><Content>meetings, bolt upright, with folded arms, as if she were in school, her</Content><Content>bright, beady eyes fixed unblinkingly upon Mrs. Arnold, whom she seemed</Content><Content>to regard as a species of priestess in charge of occult mysteries.</Content><Content>"Would I be struck dumb if I told what goes on here?" she asked Ulyth</Content><Content>one day; and, although she was assured that no such act of vengeance on</Content><Content>the part of Providence would overtake her, she nevertheless preserved a</Content><Content>secrecy worthy of a Freemason, and would drop no hint in the kitchen as</Content><Content>to the nature of the ceremonies she witnessed.</Content><Content>One or two points evidently made a great impression upon her. During the</Content><Content>spring months Nature lore was very much to the fore, and the members</Content><Content>qualified for candidateship to the various grades by exhibiting their</Content><Content>knowledge of the ways and habits of birds. Notes of observations were</Content><Content>read aloud at the meetings, particulars recorded of nests that had been</Content><Content>built in the school grounds, with data as to the number of days in which</Content><Content>eggs were hatched and the young ones fledged. It was an unwritten law at</Content><Content>The Woodlands never to disturb the birds. The girls were not allowed to</Content><Content>take any eggs from the nests, and were taught not to frighten a sitting</Content><Content>bird or to interfere with the fledge-lings. After several years of such</Content><Content>consideration The Woodlands had become a kind of bird sanctuary, where</Content><Content>the little songsters appeared to know they were free from molestation.</Content><Content>That the fruit in the garden suffered rather a heavy toll was true; but,</Content><Content>as Miss Bowes remarked: "One can't have everything. We must remember how</Content><Content>many insects they clear away, and not grudge them a few currants and</Content><Content>gooseberries. They pay us by their lovely songs in the spring."</Content><Content>Ulyth was a great devotee of Nature study, and had the supreme</Content><Content>satisfaction of being the first to discover that a pair of long-tailed</Content><Content>tits were building in a gorse-bush down the paddock. She was immensely</Content><Content>excited, for they were rather rare birds in that district, and generally</Content><Content>nested much higher up on the hills. This was indeed the only instance on</Content><Content>record of their having selected The Woodlands for their domestic</Content><Content>operations. As she had made the discovery, it was her particular</Content><Content>privilege to take the observations, and every day she would go very</Content><Content>quietly and cautiously and seat herself near the spot to note the doings</Content><Content>of the shy little architects. It was a subject of intense interest to</Content><Content>watch the globular nest grow, and then to ascertain, when the parents</Content><Content>were out of the way, that eggs had actually been laid in it. Ulyth was</Content><Content>so afraid of disturbing the tits that she conducted her daily</Content><Content>observations alone, fearing lest even Lizzie's presence might frighten</Content><Content>them. "When there are two of us we can't help talking, and an unusual</Content><Content>sound scares them worse than anything," she decided.</Content><Content>One morning she started for her daily expedition to the paddock. The</Content><Content>little hen had been sitting long enough to make Ulyth think the eggs</Content><Content>must surely be hatched, and that probably the parents were both already</Content><Content>busy catering for their progeny. She crept noiselessly round the corner</Content><Content>to the hollow where the bushes were situated. Then she gave a gasp and a</Content><Content>cry of horror. On the ground, quite close to the nest, knelt Susannah</Content><Content>Maude, busily occupied in smearing some sticky white substance over the</Content><Content>lower boughs and shoots of the gorse-bushes. She looked round with a</Content><Content>beaming face as Ulyth approached. Her beady eyes twinkled with</Content><Content>self-congratulation.</Content><Content>"Susannah! What are you doing, you young imp of mischief?" exclaimed</Content><Content>Ulyth in an agony.</Content><Content>"Catching your birds for you, Miss," responded the orphan, a thrill of</Content><Content>pride in her voice. "It's bird-lime, this is, and it'll soon stick 'em,</Content><Content>you'll see. I knows all about it, for my father was a bird-catcher, and</Content><Content>I often went with him when I was a kid. I'd a job to get the lime, I can</Content><Content>tell you, but Bobby Jones brought me some from Llangarmon."</Content><Content>She looked at Ulyth with a smile, as if waiting for the praise that she</Content><Content>deemed due to her efforts. Utterly aghast, Ulyth stammered:</Content><Content>"But, Susannah Maude, we--we don't want the birds caught."</Content><Content>The orphan appeared puzzled. A shade crossed her sharp little face.</Content><Content>"Not want to catch 'em? What's the use of 'em, then? Dad caught 'em and</Content><Content>sold 'em."</Content><Content>Ulyth had to keep a strong curb over her temper. After all, how could</Content><Content>this ignorant child know what she had never been taught? Miss Bowes</Content><Content>might well preach patience and forbearance.</Content><Content>"It's very cruel to snare the birds with lime at any time, especially</Content><Content>now, when they have young ones who would starve without them," she</Content><Content>explained with what calm she could muster. "Promise me that you will</Content><Content>never try to do such a thing again, and never interfere with any of the</Content><Content>nests. Mrs. Arnold will be most grieved to hear of this."</Content><Content>The orphan's black eyes filled with tears.</Content><Content>"Will she mind? I thought she'd like 'em to keep in a cage as pets. I'd</Content><Content>do anything in the world to please her."</Content><Content>"Then leave the birds alone, if you want to please her. Run now to the</Content><Content>house and fetch me a basin full of hot water and a cloth. I must wipe</Content><Content>all this horrible stuff off the bushes. Bring a knife, too, for I shall</Content><Content>have to cut away some of the branches and burn them. I hope the tits</Content><Content>won't desert."</Content><Content>Ulyth was late for school that morning, but the offence was condoned by</Content><Content>Miss Teddington when she heard the reason.</Content><Content>"I hope you washed every scrap of the lime off?" she asked anxiously.</Content><Content>"I didn't leave it while there was enough to catch even a bumble-bee.</Content><Content>The birds are back. They came directly I'd gone a dozen yards away."</Content><Content>"That shows the young ones are hatched. I hope Susan won't direct her</Content><Content>energies into any other natural-history experiments."</Content><Content>"We shall be sorry we brought her to the Camp-fire if she does. She</Content><Content>means well, but the worst of her is that you never can calculate in the</Content><Content>least what she may do next. She's a problem."</Content><Content>       *       *       *       *       *</Content><Content>During the summer term the Camp-fire Guild had many informal meetings by</Content><Content>the stream. The girls were often allowed to take tea there, a permission</Content><Content>which they highly appreciated. Mrs. Arnold had lent them a small</Content><Content>camp-oven, in which they could bake cakes, and many culinary efforts</Content><Content>resulted from the acquisition. On Saturday afternoon Gertrude Oliver and</Content><Content>Addie Knighton were on the cooking-list as special scouts, and, having</Content><Content>mixed some currant-buns, placed them carefully in the oven. They were in</Content><Content>charge of the camp-fire and responsible for the preparation of the tea,</Content><Content>to which that day all the mistresses were to be specially invited. The</Content><Content>rest of the school were in the playing-field practising flag-signalling</Content><Content>under the joint superintendence of Mrs. Arnold and Miss Teddington.</Content><Content>"It's a nuisance we can't leave the cakes," sighed Addie. "I did so want</Content><Content>to see them send that message about the aeroplane."</Content><Content>"They're baking all right," said Gertrude. "We can't make them any</Content><Content>quicker by looking at them. Couldn't we just run to the top of the</Content><Content>gravel-pit and watch for a few minutes? There's Susannah Maude; she'd</Content><Content>keep an eye on them. Hello! Susan!"</Content><Content>The orphan, in virtue of being a hanger-on of the Camp-fire, was</Content><Content>wandering about by the stream in the wake of the proceedings. She came</Content><Content>running up eagerly at Gertrude's call.</Content><Content>"I'll mind 'em for you, Miss. I've watched Cook dozens of times. I'll</Content><Content>look after the kettle too. You leave it to me."</Content><Content>"I hope it won't be a case of King Alfred and the cakes."</Content><Content>Susan grinned comprehension.</Content><Content>"Standard V Historical Reader. Not me!" she chuckled. "I always thought</Content><Content>the woman was a silly to trust a man to turn the cakes."</Content><Content>"Well, mind you show up better. You might as well put the milk-can in</Content><Content>the stream to keep cool. We don't want it curdled, and I'm certain</Content><Content>there's thunder about."</Content><Content>Addie and Gertie were sure they were not absent long. They just stood</Content><Content>and watched a few messages being sent, then ran back promptly to their</Content><Content>duties.</Content><Content>Susannah Maude was in the very act of trying to lift the big camp-kettle</Content><Content>from its trivet.</Content><Content>"Hold hard there!" screamed Addie, running to the rescue. "You can't</Content><Content>move that alone. Susan! Stop!" It was too late, however. The small</Content><Content>busybody had managed to stir the kettle, but, her youthful arms being</Content><Content>quite unequal to sustaining its weight, she let it drop, retreating with</Content><Content>a wild Indian yell of alarm. The stream of boiling water fortunately</Content><Content>escaped her, but nearly put out the fire. When the steam and dust had</Content><Content>subsided, the rueful scouts picked up the empty kettle gingerly, as it</Content><Content>was hot.</Content><Content>"We shall have to build up the fire again," lamented Gertrude. "Oh,</Content><Content>Addie, the cakes!"</Content><Content>She might well exclaim. In a row among the ashes were the soaked,</Content><Content>dust-covered remains of the precious currant-buns.</Content><Content>"I took 'em out of the oven because they were done," explained Susan</Content><Content>hastily, justifying herself. "I thought you shouldn't blame me for</Content><Content>letting 'em burn, anyhow; and I put 'em down there on some dock-leaves</Content><Content>to keep hot. I couldn't tell the kettle would fall on 'em."</Content><Content>"They're done for," sighed Addie. "There isn't one fit to eat. Help us</Content><Content>to fill the kettle again as soon as you can, and fetch some more sticks</Content><Content>and gorse, you black-eyed Susan!"</Content><Content>"Where's the milk-can?" asked Gertrude uneasily.</Content><Content>"I put it in the stream as you told me," replied the orphan rather</Content><Content>sulkily, indicating with a nod the location.</Content><Content>Decidedly anxious as to its safety, the girls ran to the water-side.</Content><Content>They always put the can in a particular little sheltered corner fenced</Content><Content>in by a few stones. Susannah had helped them to place it there many</Content><Content>times, and had even named the spot "the dairy". They looked in vain. The</Content><Content>milk was certainly not there now.</Content><Content>"What in the name of thunder have you done with the can, you wretched</Content><Content>imp?" shouted Addie, thoroughly angry.</Content><Content>"You said it ought to keep very cool, so I threw it into the deep pool.</Content><Content>'Tain't my fault," retorted Susannah, who had a temper as well as her</Content><Content>benefactresses.</Content><Content>"I've half a mind to throw you after it!" raged Gertie, her fingers</Content><Content>twitching to shake the luckless orphan.</Content><Content>Perhaps Susannah's experienced eye gauged the extent of her wrath, and</Content><Content>decided that for once she had gone too far. She did not wait to proffer</Content><Content>any more explanations, but turned and fled back towards the house,</Content><Content>resuming her neglected pan-scouring in the scullery with a zeal that</Content><Content>astonished the cook.</Content><Content>Addie and Gertie replenished the camp-fire and refilled the kettle; but</Content><Content>the cakes were hopeless, and the milk was beyond recall. Doris Deane,</Content><Content>the champion swimmer of the school, dived for the can next morning and</Content><Content>brought it up empty; the lid was never recovered, probably having been</Content><Content>washed into a hole.</Content><Content>The Guild sat down that afternoon rather disconsolately to milkless tea.</Content><Content>Addie had begged a small jugful from the kitchen, enough for their</Content><Content>guests, the mistresses, but it was impossible to replace the big</Content><Content>two-gallon can at a moment's notice.</Content><Content>"I begin to wish the school had never supported an orphan at the</Content><Content>'Alexandra Home for Destitute Children'," sighed Gertie, eating plain</Content><Content>bread and butter, and thinking regretfully of her spoilt cakes. "I vote</Content><Content>next term we ask to give up collecting for it, and keep a monkey at the</Content><Content>Zoo instead. We could send it nuts and biscuits at Christmas."</Content><Content>"And currant-buns?" giggled Beth Broadway.</Content><Content>"You are about the most unfeeling wretch I ever came across!" snapped</Content><Content>Gertrude.</Content><Content>CHAPTER XV</Content><Content>A Point of Honour</Content><Content>"Lizzie," announced Ulyth, sitting down on a stump in the glade, and</Content><Content>speaking slowly and emphatically, "The Woodlands isn't what it used to</Content><Content>be."</Content><Content>"So Stephanie was saying the other day," agreed Lizzie, taking a seat on</Content><Content>the stump by the side of her friend. "She thinks it's a different place</Content><Content>altogether."</Content><Content>"It is; though not exactly from Stephie's point of view. I don't care</Content><Content>the least scrap that there are no Vernons or Courtenays or Derringtons</Content><Content>here now. Stephie can lament them if she likes. I never knew them, so I</Content><Content>can't regret them. There's one thing I can't help noticing, though--the</Content><Content>tone has been going down."</Content><Content>"Do you think it has?" replied Lizzie thoughtfully. "Merle and Alice and</Content><Content>Mary are rather silly, certainly, but there's not much harm in them."</Content><Content>"I don't mean our form; it's the juniors. I've noticed it continually</Content><Content>lately."</Content><Content>"Now you come to speak of it, so have I. I don't quite know what it is,</Content><Content>but there's a something."</Content><Content>"There's a very decided something. It's come on quite lately, but it's</Content><Content>there. They're not behaving nicely at all. They've slacked all round,</Content><Content>and do nothing but snigger among themselves over jokes they won't tell."</Content><Content>"They're welcome to their own jokes as far as I'm concerned, the young</Content><Content>idiots!"</Content><Content>"Yes, if it's only just fun; but I'm afraid it's something more than</Content><Content>that--something they're ashamed of and really want to hide. I've seen</Content><Content>such shuffling and queer business going on when any of the monitresses</Content><Content>came in sight."</Content><Content>"Have you said anything to Catherine or Helen?"</Content><Content>"No, and I don't want to. It's very unfortunate, but they've really got</Content><Content>no tact. Catherine's so high-handed, and Helen's nearly as bad. They</Content><Content>snap the girls up for the least trifle. The result is the juniors have</Content><Content>got it into their tiresome young heads that monitresses are a species of</Content><Content>teacher. They weren't intended to be that at all. A monitress is just</Content><Content>one of ourselves, only with authority that we all allow. She ought to be</Content><Content>jolly with everybody."</Content><Content>"Um! You can hardly call Catherine jolly with the kids."</Content><Content>"That's just it. They resent it; they've gone their own way lately, and</Content><Content>it's been decidedly downhill. I'm persuaded they're playing some deep</Content><Content>and surreptitious game at present. I wish I knew what it was."</Content><Content>"Can't Rona tell you?"</Content><Content>"I wouldn't pump Rona for the world. It's most frightfully difficult for</Content><Content>her, a junior, to be room-mate with a senior. Her form always suspect</Content><Content>her of giving them away to the Upper School. Rona's had a hard enough</Content><Content>struggle to get any footing at all at The Woodlands, and I don't want to</Content><Content>make it any harder for her. If she once gets the reputation of</Content><Content>'tell-tale' she's done for. Since Stephanie made that fuss about juniors</Content><Content>coming into senior rooms I mayn't ask her into V B; so if she's</Content><Content>ostracized by her own form too she'll be neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor</Content><Content>good red herring. No; however I find out it mustn't be through Rona."</Content><Content>"Yes, I quite see your point. Now you speak of it, I believe those</Content><Content>juniors are up to something. There's a prodigious amount of whispering</Content><Content>and sniggering among them. 'What's the joke?' I said to Tootie Phillips</Content><Content>yesterday, and she flared out in the most truculent manner: 'That's our</Content><Content>own business, thank you!'"</Content><Content>"Tootie has been making herself most objectionable lately. She wants</Content><Content>sitting upon."</Content><Content>"Catherine will do that, never fear."</Content><Content>"No doubt, but it doesn't bring us any nearer finding out what those</Content><Content>juniors are after."</Content><Content>"They vanish mysteriously after tea sometimes. I vote we watch them, and</Content><Content>next time it happens we'll stalk them."</Content><Content>"Right-O! But not a word to anybody else, or it might get about and put</Content><Content>them on their guard."</Content><Content>"Trust me! I wouldn't even flicker an eyelid."</Content><Content>Now that Ulyth and Lizzie had compared notes on the subject of the</Content><Content>juniors, they became more convinced than ever of the fact that something</Content><Content>surreptitious was going on. Nods, hints, words which apparently bore a</Content><Content>hidden meaning, nudges, and signs were the order of the day. All</Content><Content>friendly advances on the part of seniors were repelled, the younger</Content><Content>girls keeping strictly to themselves. This was the more marked as there</Content><Content>had never been any very great division at The Woodlands between Upper</Content><Content>and Lower School, the whole of the little community sharing in most of</Content><Content>the general interests.</Content><Content>After tea there was a short interval before evening preparation began,</Content><Content>and during the summer term this was spent, if possible, out-of-doors by</Content><Content>everybody. One afternoon, only a few days after the conversation just</Content><Content>recorded, the girls had filed as usual from the dining-hall, and were</Content><Content>racing off for tennis, basket-ball, or a run by the stream. As Ulyth,</Content><Content>down on her knees in the darkest part of the hall cupboard, groped for</Content><Content>her mislaid tennis-shoes, two members of IV B came in for a moment to</Content><Content>fetch balls. They were in a hurry and they evidently did not perceive</Content><Content>her presence.</Content><Content>"Did you get the tip?" Irene Scott asked Ethel Jephson under her breath.</Content><Content>"By the lower pool immediately."</Content><Content>"All serene! Tootie told me herself."</Content><Content>"Pass it on then; though I think most know."</Content><Content>As they ran down the passage, Ulyth, relinquishing her hunt for the</Content><Content>missing shoes, rose to her feet.</Content><Content>"There's one here who didn't know," she chuckled. "This is a most</Content><Content>important piece of information. Immediately, by the lower pool, is it?</Content><Content>Well, I must go and find Lizzie. What are those precious juniors up to,</Content><Content>I wonder?"</Content><Content>Lizzie was taking her racket for a game of tennis, but she readily gave</Content><Content>up her place to Merle Denham at a hint from Ulyth.</Content><Content>"I told you they vanished after tea," she said, as the two girls</Content><Content>sauntered into the glen. "We'll track them this time. Don't on any</Content><Content>account look as if you were going anywhere. Sit down here and give them</Content><Content>a few minutes' grace, in case stragglers come up. They probably won't</Content><Content>begin punctually. I'll time it by my watch."</Content><Content>When five minutes had elapsed there was not a solitary junior to be seen</Content><Content>in the glade, and Ulyth and Lizzie, deeming themselves safe, set out in</Content><Content>the direction of the lower pool.</Content><Content>This was a part of the stream at the very verge of the grounds belonging</Content><Content>to The Woodlands; indeed, the greater portion of it lay in the land of a</Content><Content>neighbouring farmer, and to reach its pebbly bank meant a scramble round</Content><Content>some palings and under a projecting piece of rock.</Content><Content>Ulyth and Lizzie were too wary to follow the juniors by this path, but</Content><Content>scaled the palings at another point, and under cover of a thick copse of</Content><Content>gorse-bushes approached the pool from the side that lay in the farmer's</Content><Content>field. By most careful scouting they found a spot on the bank where they</Content><Content>could see and hear without being seen.</Content><Content>Below them, seated on the rocks by the edge of the water, were</Content><Content>practically almost the whole of the Lower School. They cuddled close,</Content><Content>with their arms round each other, and to judge from their repressed</Content><Content>giggles they appeared to be enjoying themselves. Tootie Phillips, a</Content><Content>long-legged, excitable girl of thirteen, mounted upon a boulder, was</Content><Content>addressing them with much fervour. Ulyth and Lizzie missed the beginning</Content><Content>of her remarks, but when they came within earshot they realized that she</Content><Content>was in the midst of a vigorous harangue against the seniors.</Content><Content>"Are we to be trodden down just because we're a little younger than they</Content><Content>are?" urged Tootie. "Why should they lord it over us, I should like to</Content><Content>know? They were juniors themselves only a year or two ago. I tell you</Content><Content>the worm will turn."</Content><Content>"It's turned pretty considerably," guffawed Cissie Newall.</Content><Content>"It knows which side its bread's buttered," cackled Irene Scott.</Content><Content>"Buttered! You mean sugared, don't you?"</Content><Content>At this sally the whole party broke into a shout of laughter.</Content><Content>"Good for you, Ciss!"</Content><Content>"Sugared! Ra--ther!"</Content><Content>"Shut up, you sillies! Someone will hear us," commanded Tootie. "I was</Content><Content>saying before, we're not going to be sat upon, either by teachers or</Content><Content>monitresses or seniors. We'll take our own way."</Content><Content>"A sugary way," chirped Ethel Jephson.</Content><Content>The girls hinnied again. There was evidently something underlying the</Content><Content>joke.</Content><Content>"When perfectly ridiculous rules are made, that never ought to have been</Content><Content>made," continued Tootie, "then we've a right to take the law into our</Content><Content>own hands and do as we please."</Content><Content>"Our pocket money's our own," grumbled a discontented spirit from the</Content><Content>back.</Content><Content>"Of course it is, and we ought to be able to do what we like with it."</Content><Content>"And so are our brooches, if we want to----"</Content><Content>"Sh--sh!"</Content><Content>"Shut up, stupid!"</Content><Content>"Well, we all know."</Content><Content>"No need to blare it out, if we do."</Content><Content>"I wasn't blaring."</Content><Content>"Violet Robertson, remember your oath," commanded Tootie. "If you let a</Content><Content>word of--we know what--leak out, you're sent to Coventry for the rest of</Content><Content>the term. Yes. Not a single one of us will speak one single word to you.</Content><Content>Not even your own room-mates. So there!"</Content><Content>"Well, you needn't make such a precious fuss. I'm sure I wasn't letting</Content><Content>out secrets," retorted Violet sulkily. "But I think there ought to be</Content><Content>some rate of value. My brooch was a far better one than Mollie's."</Content><Content>"Right you are, my hearty, and I'm going to speak about it. We mustn't</Content><Content>let ourselves be done, even by--you know who!"</Content><Content>"And she's sharp."</Content><Content>"She's getting too sharp. We must stop it, even if we have to break off</Content><Content>for a whole week."</Content><Content>"No, no!"</Content><Content>"Oh, not that anyhow!"</Content><Content>"Well, look here, if you're such sillies, you deserve----"</Content><Content>But at this most interesting point the loud clanging of the</Content><Content>preparation-bell put a stop to any further argument. With one accord the</Content><Content>girls jumped up, and fled back as fast as they could run in the</Content><Content>direction of the school. Ulyth and Lizzie, at the risk of being late for</Content><Content>evening call-over, gave the conspirators time to get well away before</Content><Content>they ventured to follow.</Content><Content>"What's the meaning of all this?" queried Lizzie, as they scouted</Content><Content>cautiously through the glade.</Content><Content>"I can't imagine. They're evidently doing something they oughtn't to,</Content><Content>the young wretches! But they're keeping it very dark."</Content><Content>"We shall have to watch them."</Content><Content>"We must indeed," sighed Ulyth. "Lizzie, I loathe eavesdropping and</Content><Content>anything that savours of underhand work, but what are we to do?</Content><Content>Something is going wrong among the juniors, and for the sake of the</Content><Content>school we've got to put it right if we possibly can. It's no use asking</Content><Content>them their sweet secret, for they wouldn't tell us; and I'm afraid</Content><Content>setting the monitresses on the track would only make things worse. If we</Content><Content>can find out what they're doing, then we shall know our ground. I'm a</Content><Content>Torch-bearer and you're a Fire-maker, and we must appeal to them to keep</Content><Content>their Camp-fire vows. But we can't do that till we've some idea of which</Content><Content>rule they're breaking. How can we say to them: 'I strongly suspect</Content><Content>you're not being trustworthy'? We've got to prove our words."</Content><Content>"Prove them we will. We'll dodge about till we catch them in the act,"</Content><Content>agreed Lizzie.</Content><Content>To both the girls it was uncongenial though necessary work. As seniors</Content><Content>and League officers they felt they owed a duty to the school, but that</Content><Content>it would be far wiser to appeal privately to the juniors' sense of</Content><Content>honour, and win them back to straight paths of their own free will, than</Content><Content>to carry the matter to head-quarters. For the present, patience and tact</Content><Content>must be their watchwords.</Content><Content>Several days went by, and nothing particular occurred. Either the</Content><Content>younger girls were on their guard or they had suspended their</Content><Content>activities. On Friday evening, however, as Ulyth was coming along the</Content><Content>passage from practising, she accidentally cannonaded into half a dozen</Content><Content>members of IV B who were standing near the boot cupboard. She evidently</Content><Content>surprised them, for one and all they hastily popped their hands into</Content><Content>their pockets. It was promptly done, but not so quickly as to prevent</Content><Content>Ulyth from seeing that they were eating something.</Content><Content>"It's all right," gasped Bertha Halliwell, with apparent unconcern, in</Content><Content>reply to Ulyth's apologies. "You nearly upset me, but I'm not</Content><Content>fractured."</Content><Content>"I wish you'd take care, though," grumbled Etta Jessop, surreptitiously</Content><Content>wiping a decidedly sticky mouth; "no one likes being tumbled over."</Content><Content>Ulyth passed on thoughtfully. What had they all been munching, and where</Content><Content>did they get it from? Private supplies of cakes and sweets were utterly</Content><Content>forbidden at The Woodlands. Their prohibition was one of the strictest</Content><Content>rules of the school, to break which would be to incur a very severe</Content><Content>penalty from Miss Teddington. Was this the explanation of Tootie's</Content><Content>rather enigmatical remarks down by the stream?</Content><Content>"If that's their precious secret, and they're just being greedy, I'm too</Content><Content>disgusted with them for words!" commented Lizzie, when informed of the</Content><Content>discovery.</Content><Content>Saturday and Monday passed with quite exemplary behaviour on the part of</Content><Content>the juniors. The keenest vigilance could discover nothing. But on</Content><Content>Tuesday Lizzie came across another clue. She had been monitress for the</Content><Content>afternoon in the drawing-class, and after the girls had left she stayed</Content><Content>behind to put away various articles that had been used and to tidy the</Content><Content>room.</Content><Content>As she worked along the desks where IV B had been sitting, collecting</Content><Content>stray pencils and pieces of india-rubber, she noticed a book lying on</Content><Content>the floor and picked it up. It was a French grammar, with "Etta Jessop"</Content><Content>written on the fly-leaf and had evidently been accidentally dropped. She</Content><Content>turned over the pages idly. In the middle was a scrap of paper torn from</Content><Content>an exercise-book, and on this was scribbled: "Where will she be</Content><Content>to-night?" while in a different hand, underneath, as if in answer to the</Content><Content>question, were the words: "Side gate at 8. Pass, 'John Barleycorn'."</Content><Content>This was most important. It was the first, indeed the only definite,</Content><Content>information they had to go upon. Lizzie replaced the slip of paper and</Content><Content>laid the book on the floor just where she had found it. Etta would no</Content><Content>doubt soon discover her loss, and come back to fetch it. In the meantime</Content><Content>this very valuable piece of news must be communicated to Ulyth.</Content><Content>The chums talked the matter over earnestly.</Content><Content>"Something's happening at the side gate at eight o'clock, and they've</Content><Content>got a password; that's clear," said Lizzie.</Content><Content>"Then I think it's our plain duty to go and investigate," returned</Content><Content>Ulyth. "If the worst comes to the worst we could report ourselves, and</Content><Content>tell Teddie why we went. She'd understand."</Content><Content>"I hope it won't need that," fluttered Lizzie nervously.</Content><Content>The girls were not allowed out of the house after preparation, so any</Content><Content>excursions into the garden were distinctly against the rules.</Content><Content>Feeling very culpable at thus breaking the law of the school, Ulyth and</Content><Content>Lizzie crept quietly from the cloak-room door soon after eight had</Content><Content>struck. It was not yet dark, but the sun had sunk behind the hills, and</Content><Content>the garden was in deep shadow. They passed the tennis-courts and the</Content><Content>rose parterre, and ran down the steps into the herbarium. Just at the</Content><Content>outskirts of the shrubbery a small figure was skulking among the bushes.</Content><Content>At the sound of footsteps it gave a low, peculiar whistle, then advanced</Content><Content>slightly from the shadow and stood at attention, as if in mute challenge</Content><Content>of the new-comers. Irene Scott, for it was she, was evidently on sentry</Content><Content>duty. No one with a knowledge of camp-life could mistake her attitude.</Content><Content>"We'll bluff it off," whispered Ulyth, and, taking Lizzie's arm, she</Content><Content>marched quietly past, murmuring: "John Barleycorn".</Content><Content>The effect of the password was electrical. Irene looked immensely</Content><Content>astonished. She had certainly not expected such knowledge on the part</Content><Content>of seniors.</Content><Content>"Are you in it too? Oh, goody!" she gasped; then very softly she called:</Content><Content>"All's well!" and, turning, dived back among the bushes.</Content><Content>Lizzie and Ulyth pushed on towards the side gate. It was open, and</Content><Content>inside, under the shelter of a big laurel, stood a woman with a basket.</Content><Content>She was a gipsy-looking person, with long ear-rings, and she wore a</Content><Content>red-and-yellow handkerchief tied round her neck. As the girls approached</Content><Content>she uncovered her basket with a knowing smile.</Content><Content>"I've brought plenty to-night, Missies," she said ingratiatingly.</Content><Content>"Cheesecakes and vanilla sandwiches and coco-nut drops and cream wafers.</Content><Content>What'll you please to have?"</Content><Content>"Are you selling them?" asked Ulyth in much amazement.</Content><Content>The woman glanced at her keenly.</Content><Content>"I've not seen you two before," she remarked. "Yes, dearie, I'm selling</Content><Content>them. They're wholesome cakes, and won't do you any harm. Try these</Content><Content>cream wafers."</Content><Content>"No, thanks! We don't want anything," stammered Lizzie.</Content><Content>"If you've spent all your money," persisted the hawker, "I'm always open</Content><Content>to take a trinket instead. There's a young lady been here just now, and</Content><Content>gave me this in place of a sixpence," showing a small brooch pinned into</Content><Content>her bodice. "Of course such things aren't worth much to me, but I'd do</Content><Content>it to oblige you."</Content><Content>At the sight of the little brooch Ulyth flushed hotly.</Content><Content>"We're not allowed to buy cakes and tarts," she replied. "I'm sure Miss</Content><Content>Bowes doesn't know that you come here to sell things. It's not your</Content><Content>fault, of course, but please don't come again. It's breaking the rules</Content><Content>of the school."</Content><Content>The woman covered up her basket in an instant.</Content><Content>"All right, Missie, all right," she said suavely. "I don't want to press</Content><Content>things on you. That's not my way. You won't catch me at this gate again,</Content><Content>I promise you. Good night!" and, slipping out into the lane, she was</Content><Content>gone directly.</Content><Content>Ulyth shut the door and bolted it.</Content><Content>"She mayn't come to this particular spot again," said Lizzie, "but</Content><Content>she'll find some other meeting-place, the cunning old thing. I could see</Content><Content>it in her eye. So this is their grand secret! What a remarkably</Content><Content>honourable and creditable one!"</Content><Content>"It's worse than I thought," groaned Ulyth. "They must have been going</Content><Content>on with this business for some time, Lizzie. Do you know, that brooch</Content><Content>was Rona's. I recognized it at once. It's one she brought from New</Content><Content>Zealand, with a Maori device on it."</Content><Content>"I thought better of Rona."</Content><Content>"So did I. She's improved so much I didn't think she'd slip back in this</Content><Content>way."</Content><Content>"I believe Tootie Phillips is the ring-leader."</Content><Content>"There's no doubt of it. From all we've seen, the juniors have got a</Content><Content>systematic traffic with this woman, and post scouts to keep watch while</Content><Content>she's about. You heard Irene call: 'All's well!'"</Content><Content>"They'll be feasting in their bedroom to-night."</Content><Content>"Rona won't dare, surely. Lizzie, I shouldn't have thought much of it if</Content><Content>they'd done it once just for a lark. We're all human, and juniors will</Content><Content>be juniors. But when it gets systematic, and they begin to sell their</Content><Content>brooches, that's a different matter."</Content><Content>"What are you going to do? Tackle the kids and tell them we've found</Content><Content>out, and they've got to stop it?"</Content><Content>"Will they really stop it just at our bidding? Or will it only put them</Content><Content>on their guard and make them carry the thing on with more caution?"</Content><Content>"Then give a hint to the monitresses?"</Content><Content>"I wonder if we ought. I wish Catherine and Helen were different."</Content><Content>"Well, what do you suggest?"</Content><Content>"There's only one other way. Mrs. Arnold is coming to The Woodlands on</Content><Content>Friday afternoon. Suppose we wait, catch her alone, and tell her all</Content><Content>about it. She's our 'Guardian of the Fire', and we ought to be able to</Content><Content>ask her things when we're in difficulties. She doesn't belong to the</Content><Content>school, so it isn't like telling a teacher or a monitress. We know we</Content><Content>can trust her absolutely."</Content><Content>"Right-O! But it seems a long time to have to wait."</Content><Content>"It can't be helped," said Ulyth, as they hurried back through the</Content><Content>garden.</Content><Content>She had decided, as she thought, for the best, though, as the result</Content><Content>proved, she had chosen a most unfortunate course.</Content><Content>CHAPTER XVI</Content><Content>Amateur Conjuring</Content><Content>Ulyth went to her bedroom that evening in much agitation of mind. She</Content><Content>was torn by conflicting impulses. At one moment she longed to tax Rona</Content><Content>frankly with a breach of school rules, air the whole subject, and state</Content><Content>her most emphatic opinion upon it. If Rona alone had been concerned in</Content><Content>the matter she would have done so without hesitation, but the knowledge</Content><Content>of the number of girls who were involved made her pause.</Content><Content>"I might do more harm than good," she reflected. "After the way Tootie</Content><Content>has been inciting them to take sides against the seniors, they'd be up</Content><Content>in arms at the least hint. It will be worse if they know they're</Content><Content>discovered, and yet go on in an even more underhand fashion."</Content><Content>Ulyth's abstraction was so marked that her room-mate could not fail to</Content><Content>notice it.</Content><Content>"What's the matter with you to-night?" she asked. "I've never seen you</Content><Content>so glum before. Have you been getting into a row with Teddie?"</Content><Content>"I'm all right. One can't always be talking, I suppose," returned Ulyth</Content><Content>rather huffily. "Some people go on like a perpetual gramophone."</Content><Content>"Meaning Corona Margarita Mitchell, I suppose? As you like, O Queen!</Content><Content>I'll shut up if my babble offends the royal ears. There! Don't look so</Content><Content>tragic. I don't want to make myself a nuisance. But all the same it's</Content><Content>depressing to see you looking like a mixture of Hamlet and Ophelia and</Content><Content>Iphigenia and--and--Don Quixote. Was he tragic too? I forget."</Content><Content>"Hardly," said Ulyth, smiling in spite of herself.</Content><Content>"Well, I get mixed up among history and literature, can't always</Content><Content>remember which is real and which is make-up. It's a fact. I put down</Content><Content>Portia as history in my exercise yesterday, and said the story of the</Content><Content>Spanish Armada was told by Chaucer. Now you're laughing, and you look</Content><Content>more like Ulyth Stanton. Sit down on this bed. There! Open your mouth</Content><Content>and shut your eyes, and see what the king will send you!"</Content><Content>Rona was fumbling in her drawer as she spoke. She turned round, seized</Content><Content>her friend boisterously and forced her on to the bed, then, holding a</Content><Content>hand over her eyes, crammed a chocolate almond into her mouth.</Content><Content>"Rona! What are you doing?" protested Ulyth, shaking herself free.</Content><Content>"Where did you get this chocolate?"</Content><Content>Rona pulled a face expressive of mingled secrecy, delight, and triumph.</Content><Content>"Rats!" she chuckled enigmatically. "Little girls shouldn't ask</Content><Content>questions."</Content><Content>"But I want to know."</Content><Content>"That's not sporty! Take the goods the gods send you, and don't ask 'em</Content><Content>what tree they picked them from."</Content><Content>"But, Rona----"</Content><Content>"Are you two girls still out of bed and talking?" said an indignant</Content><Content>voice, as Miss Lodge opened the door and glared reproval. "Make haste. I</Content><Content>give you three minutes, and if you're not ready by then I shall report</Content><Content>you. Not another word! I'm astonished at you, Ulyth, for breaking the</Content><Content>silence rule."</Content><Content>"I didn't hear the half-past nine bell," replied Ulyth, abashed.</Content><Content>"Then it's your business to hear it. It's loud enough. Everybody else on</Content><Content>the landing is in bed."</Content><Content>Miss Lodge put out the light and walked away, with a final warning</Content><Content>against further conversation. Rona was asleep in a few minutes,</Content><Content>breathing calmly and peacefully as was her wont, but Ulyth lay awake for</Content><Content>a long time watching a shadow on the wall cast from the beech-tree</Content><Content>outside. Where had Rona got her chocolates? The answer was perfectly</Content><Content>plain. With the little brooch for evidence there could be no mistake.</Content><Content>"She's not so bad as the others, because I really don't think she quite</Content><Content>realizes even yet what school honour means. But Tootie and her scouts</Content><Content>know. There's no excuse for them. Well, only two days now, and Mrs.</Content><Content>Arnold will be here. What a tower of strength she is! I can tell her</Content><Content>everything. Friday will very soon come now, thank goodness!"</Content><Content>But those two days were to bring events of their own, events quite</Content><Content>unprecedented in the school, and unexpected by everybody. How they</Content><Content>affected Ulyth and Rona will be related farther on in our story; but</Content><Content>meantime, for a true understanding of their significance, we must pause</Content><Content>to consider a certain feature of the life at The Woodlands. When Miss</Content><Content>Teddington had joined partnership with Miss Bowes she had added many new</Content><Content>ideas to the plan of education which had formerly been pursued.</Content><Content>She was determined that the school should not be dubbed "old-fashioned",</Content><Content>and by all means in her power she kept it abreast of the times. So well</Content><Content>did she succeed that the girls were apt to complain that their second</Content><Content>Principal was a crank on education, and fond of trying every fresh</Content><Content>experiment she could get hold of. The various enterprises added an</Content><Content>atmosphere of novelty, however, and prevented the daily life from</Content><Content>degenerating into a dull routine. No one ever knew what scheme Miss</Content><Content>Teddington might suggest next; and even if each course was not pursued</Content><Content>for very long, it did its work at the time, and was a factor in the</Content><Content>general plan. All kinds and varieties of health exercises had had their</Content><Content>day at The Woodlands--poles, dumb-bells, clubs, had been in turn</Content><Content>discarded for deep breathing or for swimming motions. Slow minuets or</Content><Content>lively tarantellas were danced, according to the fashion of the moment,</Content><Content>and had the virtue of teaching stately dignity as well as poetry of</Content><Content>motion. It was rumoured sometimes that Miss Teddington, with her eye on</Content><Content>the past, contemplated a revival of backboards, stocks, and</Content><Content>chest-expanders; but those instruments of torture, fortunately, never</Content><Content>made their appearance, much to the relief of the intended victims, who</Content><Content>had viewed their advent with apprehension.</Content><Content>Naturally, dancing and indoor P.T. went on mostly in the winter months,</Content><Content>their place being taken by outdoor drill during the summer term. The</Content><Content>Camp-fire movement had appealed to Miss Teddington. She would herself</Content><Content>have liked to be "Guardian of the Fire" and general organizer of the</Content><Content>League, but her better judgment told her it was wiser to leave that</Content><Content>office to one who had not also to wield the authority of a teacher. She</Content><Content>supported the League in every way that came within her province. As</Content><Content>Camp-fire honours were given for nature study, astronomy, and geology,</Content><Content>she took care that all had a chance to qualify in those directions; and</Content><Content>lately, acting on a hint from Mrs. Arnold, she had made a special point</Content><Content>of manual training. Since Christmas the studio had assumed a new</Content><Content>importance in the school. It was a big glass-roofed room at the top of</Content><Content>the house, reached by a small stair from the west bedroom landing. A</Content><Content>carpenter's bench stood at one end of it, and wood-carving went on</Content><Content>fairly briskly. The girls might come in at any time during their</Content><Content>recreation hours, and the occupation was a great resource on wet days.</Content><Content>Bookbinding, stencilling, clay modelling, and fretwork were included</Content><Content>among the hobbies, and though there might not be definite lessons given,</Content><Content>there were handy primers of instruction on the book-shelf, and it was</Content><Content>interesting to try experiments.</Content><Content>"Do something on your own initiative. Take the book and puzzle it out,</Content><Content>even if you make a few mistakes," urged Miss Teddington. "Nothing but</Content><Content>practice can give you the right feel of your tools; you'll learn more</Content><Content>from a couple of failures than from a week's work with a teacher at your</Content><Content>elbow the whole time, saying 'Don't!'"</Content><Content>So the girls struggled on, making merry at each other's often rather</Content><Content>indifferent efforts, but gaining more skill as they learnt to handle the</Content><Content>materials with which they worked. If the mallet hit the chisel so</Content><Content>vigorously as to spoil a part of the pattern, its wielder was wiser next</Content><Content>time; and the experimenters in pyrography soon learned that a red-hot</Content><Content>needle used indiscreetly can dig holes in leather instead of ornamenting</Content><Content>it. Such "dufferisms", as the girls called them, became rarer, and many</Content><Content>quite creditable objects were turned out, and judged worthy of a</Content><Content>temporary place on the view-shelf.</Content><Content>Since Christmas a very special feature had been added to the handicraft</Content><Content>department. Miss Teddington had caused apparatus to be fixed for the</Content><Content>working of art jewellery. A furnace and a high bench with all necessary</Content><Content>equipment had been duly installed. This was a branch much too</Content><Content>technically difficult for the girls to attempt alone, so a skilled</Content><Content>teacher had been procured, who came weekly from Elwyn Bay to give</Content><Content>lessons. Those girls who took the course became intensely enthusiastic</Content><Content>over it. To make even a simple chain was interesting, but when they</Content><Content>advanced to setting polished pebbles or imitation stones as brooches or</Content><Content>pendants, the work waxed fascinating. Some of the students proved much</Content><Content>more adept than others, and turned out really pretty things.</Content><Content>There was not apparatus for many pupils to work, so the class had been</Content><Content>limited to seniors, among whom Doris Deane, Ruth White, and Stephanie</Content><Content>Radford had begun to distinguish themselves. Each had made a small</Content><Content>pendant, and while the craftsmanship might be amateurish, the general</Content><Content>effect was artistic. Miss Teddington was delighted, and wishing to air</Content><Content>her latest hobby, she decided to send the three pendants, together with</Content><Content>some other specimens of school handiwork, to a small Art exhibition</Content><Content>which was to be held shortly at Elwyn Bay. Miss Edwards, the teacher who</Content><Content>came weekly to give instruction, was on the exhibition committee, and</Content><Content>promised to devote a certain case to the articles, and place them in a</Content><Content>good light. Though small shows had been held at The Woodlands</Content><Content>occasionally in connection with the annual prize distribution, the</Content><Content>school had never before ventured to send a contribution to a public</Content><Content>exhibition, and those whose work was to be thus honoured became heroines</Content><Content>of the moment.</Content><Content>On the very evening after Ulyth's and Lizzie's excursion down the</Content><Content>garden, a number of girls repaired to the studio to view the objects</Content><Content>that Miss Teddington had chosen as worthy to represent the artistic side</Content><Content>of the school.</Content><Content>"I wish I were a senior," said Winnie Fowler plaintively. "I'd have</Content><Content>loved this sort of thing. To think of being able to make a little</Content><Content>darling, ducky brooch! It beats drawing hollow. I'd never want to touch</Content><Content>a pencil again."</Content><Content>"You've got to have some eye for drawing, though," said Doris, "or you'd</Content><Content>have your things all crooked. It's not as easy as eating chocolates, I</Content><Content>can tell you!"</Content><Content>"I dare say. But I'll try some day, when I am a senior."</Content><Content>"Are these the three that are to go to the exhibition?" asked Rona,</Content><Content>pushing her way to the front. "Which is which?"</Content><Content>"This is mine, that's Ruth's, and that's Stephanie's," explained Doris.</Content><Content>"Why isn't Ulyth's to go? It's just as nice as Stephanie's, I'm sure."</Content><Content>"Miss Teddington decided that."</Content><Content>"How idiotic of her! Why couldn't she send Ulyth's? I think hers is the</Content><Content>nicest, and it's just the same pattern as Stephie's--exactly."</Content><Content>"Do be quiet, Rona!" urged Ulyth, laying her hand on the arm of her too</Content><Content>partial friend. "My pendant has a defect in it. I bungled, and couldn't</Content><Content>get it right again afterwards."</Content><Content>"It doesn't show."</Content><Content>"Not to you, perhaps; but any judge of such things would notice in a</Content><Content>moment."</Content><Content>"Well, your work's as good as Stephanie's any day, and I hate for her</Content><Content>name to be put into the catalogue and not yours. Yes, I mean what I</Content><Content>say."</Content><Content>"Oh, Rona, do hush! I don't want my name in a catalogue. Here's Stephie</Content><Content>coming in. Don't let her hear you."</Content><Content>"I don't mind if she does. It won't do her any harm to hear somebody's</Content><Content>frank opinion."</Content><Content>"Rona, if you care one atom for me, stop!"</Content><Content>Rather grumbling, Rona allowed herself to be suppressed. She was always</Content><Content>ready to throw a shaft at Stephanie, though she knew Ulyth heartily</Content><Content>disliked the scenes which invariably followed. She took up Ulyth's</Content><Content>pendant, however, and, after ostentatiously admiring it, laid it for a</Content><Content>moment side by side with Stephanie's.</Content><Content>"There isn't a pin to choose between them," she murmured under her</Content><Content>breath, hoping Stephanie might overhear.</Content><Content>Ulyth was at the other side of the room, but Stephanie's quick ears</Content><Content>caught the whisper. She looked daggers at Rona, but she made no remark,</Content><Content>and Ulyth, returning, gently took her pendant away and placed it with</Content><Content>the other non-exhibits on the bench. It had been a wet afternoon. No</Content><Content>outdoor exercise had been possible that day, and the girls were tired of</Content><Content>all their usual indoor occupations.</Content><Content>"I wish somebody'd suggest something new to cheer us up," yawned Nellie</Content><Content>Barlow. "There's a quarter of an hour more 'rec.' It's too short to be</Content><Content>worth while getting out any apparatus, but it's long enough to be deadly</Content><Content>dull."</Content><Content>"Can't someone do some tricks?" asked Edie Maycock.</Content><Content>"All right, Toby; sit on your hind legs and beg for biscuits," laughed</Content><Content>Marjorie Earnshaw.</Content><Content>"I mean real tricks--conjuring and fortune telling; the amateur wizard,</Content><Content>you know."</Content><Content>"I don't know."</Content><Content>"Then you're stupid. Have you never seen amateur conjuring--coins that</Content><Content>vanish, and things that come out of hats?"</Content><Content>"Yes; but I couldn't do it, my good child. Being in the Sixth doesn't</Content><Content>make me a magician."</Content><Content>"We tried a little bit at home," pursued Edie. "We had a book that told</Content><Content>us how; only I never could manage it quickly. People always saw how I</Content><Content>did it."</Content><Content>"Rona's the girl for that," suggested Hattie Goodwin.</Content><Content>"Is she? Come here, Rona, I want you. Can you really and truly do</Content><Content>conjuring?"</Content><Content>"Oh, not properly!" laughed Rona. "But when I was on board ship there</Content><Content>was a gentleman who was very clever at it, and I and some boys I'd made</Content><Content>friends with were tremendously keen at learning. We got him to show us a</Content><Content>few easy tricks, and we were always trying them. I could manage it just</Content><Content>a little, but I'm out of practice now. You'd see in a second how it was</Content><Content>done, I'm afraid."</Content><Content>"Oh, do show us, just for fun!"</Content><Content>"What do you want to see?"</Content><Content>"Oh, anything!"</Content><Content>"The vanishing coin?"</Content><Content>"Yes, yes. Go ahead!"</Content><Content>"Then give me two pennies or shillings, either will do."</Content><Content>The audience who had clustered round looked at one another, each</Content><Content>expecting somebody else to produce a coin. Then everybody laughed.</Content><Content>"We haven't got so much as a copper amongst us! We're a set of absolute</Content><Content>paupers!" declared Doris. "Can't you do some other trick?"</Content><Content>"There is nothing else I could manage so well," said Rona</Content><Content>disconsolately. "This was the only one I really learnt."</Content><Content>"Can't it be done with anything but coins?"</Content><Content>"Something the same size and round, perhaps?"</Content><Content>"My pendant?" said Ulyth, fetching the trinket from the bench. "It's</Content><Content>just as big as a penny."</Content><Content>"Yes, I could try it with this and another like it. Give me</Content><Content>Stephanie's."</Content><Content>"No, no! You shan't try tricks with mine!" objected Stephanie</Content><Content>indignantly.</Content><Content>"I won't do it a scrap of harm."</Content><Content>"Oh, Stephie, don't be mean! She'll not hurt it. Here, Rona, take it!"</Content><Content>exclaimed several of the girls, anxious to witness the experiment.</Content><Content>Stephanie's protests and grumbles were overridden by the majority, and</Content><Content>Rona, in her new capacity of wizard, faced her audience.</Content><Content>"It'll be rather transparent, because you oughtn't really to know that</Content><Content>I've got two pendants," she explained apologetically. "Please forget,</Content><Content>and think it's only one. I must put some patter in, like Mr. Thompson</Content><Content>always used to do. Ladies and gentleman, you've no doubt heard that the</Content><Content>art of conjuring depends upon the quickness of the hand. That's as it</Content><Content>may be, but there is a great deal that can't be accounted for in that</Content><Content>way. Ladies and gentlemen, you see this coin--or rather pendant, as I</Content><Content>should say. I am going to make it fly from my left hand to my right.</Content><Content>One, two, three--pass! Here it is. Did you see it go? No. Well, I can</Content><Content>make it travel pretty quickly. Now we'll try another pretty little</Content><Content>experiment. You see my hand. It's empty, isn't it? Yet when I wave it</Content><Content>over this desk Miss Stephanie Radford's pendant will be returned to its</Content><Content>place. Hey, presto! Pass! There you are! Safe and sound and back again!"</Content><Content>Stephanie took up her treasure and examined it anxiously.</Content><Content>"This isn't mine!" she declared.</Content><Content>"Rubbish! It is."</Content><Content>"I tell, you it isn't! Don't I know my own work? This is Ulyth's. What</Content><Content>have you done with mine?"</Content><Content>"Vanished under the wizard's wand," mocked Rona.</Content><Content>"Give it me this instant!" cried Stephanie angrily, shaking Rona by the</Content><Content>arm.</Content><Content>Rona had been standing upon one leg, and the unexpected assault</Content><Content>completely upset her balance. She toppled, clutched at Doris, and fell,</Content><Content>bumping her head against the corner of the table. It was a hard blow,</Content><Content>and as she got up she staggered.</Content><Content>"I feel--all dizzy!" she gasped.</Content><Content>An officious junior, quite unnecessarily, ran for Miss Lodge, magnifying</Content><Content>the accident so much in her highly coloured account that the mistress</Content><Content>arrived on the scene prepared to find Rona stretched unconscious. Seeing</Content><Content>that the girl looked white and tearful, she ordered her promptly to bed.</Content><Content>"It may be nothing, but any rate you will be better lying down," she</Content><Content>decreed. "Go downstairs, girls, all of you. Nobody is to come into the</Content><Content>studio again to-night."</Content><Content>"Rona had my pendant in her hand all the time," grumbled Stephanie to</Content><Content>Beth as she obeyed the mistress's orders. "She dropped it as she fell.</Content><Content>I've put it back safely, though, and I don't mean to let anybody</Content><Content>interfere with it. I shall complain to Miss Bowes if it's touched</Content><Content>again."</Content><Content>CHAPTER XVII</Content><Content>A Storm-cloud</Content><Content>Rona woke up next morning without even a headache, in Miss Lodge's</Content><Content>opinion "justifying the prompt measures taken", but according to the</Content><Content>girls, "showing there had been nothing the matter with her to make such</Content><Content>a fuss about". Breakfast proceeded as usual, and afterwards came the</Content><Content>short interval before nine-o'clock school. Now on this day the</Content><Content>contributions to the Art exhibition were to be packed up and dispatched</Content><Content>by a special carrier, and Stephanie, as a budding metalworker, ran</Content><Content>upstairs to the studio to take one last peep at her exhibit. She flew</Content><Content>down again with white face and burning eyes.</Content><Content>"Girls!" she cried shakily. "Girls! Somebody's taken my pendant! It's</Content><Content>gone!"</Content><Content>"Why, nonsense, Stephie; it can't be gone! It was there all right last</Content><Content>night."</Content><Content>"It's not there now. Ulyth's has been put in its place, and mine's</Content><Content>vanished. Come and see."</Content><Content>There was an instant stampede for the studio.</Content><Content>"It's probably on the bench," said Doris. "Some people are such bad</Content><Content>lookers. I expect we shall find it directly."</Content><Content>"You can't find a thing that isn't there," retorted Stephanie with</Content><Content>warmth.</Content><Content>Doris considered herself an excellent looker, and, in company with a</Content><Content>dozen others, she searched the studio. Willing hands turned everything</Content><Content>over, hunted under tables, on shelves, and among shavings, but not a</Content><Content>sign of the pendant could they find.</Content><Content>"Are you sure this one isn't yours?" asked Ruth, coming back to the</Content><Content>exhibits.</Content><Content>"Certain! I know my own work. This is Ulyth's; and there's the mistake</Content><Content>she made that disqualified it."</Content><Content>"Yours was put back last night?"</Content><Content>"I saw it safe myself, after Rona'd been juggling with it. Where is</Content><Content>Rona? I believe she's at the bottom of this."</Content><Content>"She's in the garden."</Content><Content>"Then she must be fetched."</Content><Content>"What's the matter? What are you making a bother about?" cried Rona, as</Content><Content>an excited detachment of girls stopped her game of tennis and asked her</Content><Content>a dozen questions at once. "What have I done with Stephanie's pendant?</Content><Content>Why, I've done nothing with it, of course."</Content><Content>"But you must have hidden it somewhere."</Content><Content>"It's a mean trick to play on her."</Content><Content>"You and Steph are always at daggers drawn."</Content><Content>"Do go and put it back."</Content><Content>"I can't think what you're talking about!" flared Rona. "I've not even</Content><Content>been inside the studio. If a joke's being played on Stephanie, it's</Content><Content>somebody else who's doing it, not me. For goodness' sake let me get on</Content><Content>with my game. Come, Winnie, it's your serve."</Content><Content>The girls retired, whispering to one another. They were not at all</Content><Content>satisfied. The news of the loss spread rapidly over the school, and had</Content><Content>soon reached the ears of the authorities. Miss Lodge, who heard it from</Content><Content>a monitress, at once sought Miss Bowes' study. A few moments later she</Content><Content>went in a hurry to summon Miss Teddington, and a rash junior who</Content><Content>ventured within earshot was sent away with a scolding. Miss Bowes looked</Content><Content>grave as she walked into the hall for call-over. She took the names as</Content><Content>usual, then, instead of dismissing the forms, she paused impressively.</Content><Content>"I have something to say to you, girls," she began in a strained voice.</Content><Content>"A most unpleasant thing has happened this morning. The pendant made by</Content><Content>Stephanie Radford, which was to have been sent to the Elwyn Bay</Content><Content>Exhibition, has disappeared, and Ulyth Stanton's pendant has been</Content><Content>substituted for it. It is, I suppose, a practical joke on the part of</Content><Content>one of you. Now I highly disapprove of this foolish form of jesting; it</Content><Content>is neither clever nor funny, and is often very unkind. I beg whoever has</Content><Content>done this thing to come forward at once and replace the pendant. She</Content><Content>need have no fear, for she will not be punished or even scolded, though</Content><Content>she must give me her word never to repeat such a prank."</Content><Content>Miss Bowes stopped, and looked expectantly at the rows of intent eyes</Content><Content>fixed upon her. Nobody spoke and nobody moved. There was dead silence</Content><Content>in the hall. The Principal flushed with annoyance.</Content><Content>"Girls, must I appeal to your honour? Is that necessary at The</Content><Content>Woodlands? Have I actually one among you so lacking in moral courage</Content><Content>that she dare not own up? I repeat that she will meet with no reproof.</Content><Content>Nothing more will be said about the matter."</Content><Content>Still no reply. Each girl looked at her neighbour, but not even a</Content><Content>whisper was to be heard.</Content><Content>"Girls, I am exceedingly pained. Such a thing has never happened here</Content><Content>before. For the sake of the school, I make one last appeal to you. Will</Content><Content>nobody speak? Then I shall be obliged to ask each of you in turn what</Content><Content>she knows."</Content><Content>It was a dreary business putting the same question to forty-eight girls,</Content><Content>receiving one after another forty-eight decided negatives. Miss Bowes</Content><Content>sighed wearily as it came to an end, and turned to Miss Teddington, who</Content><Content>had sat on the platform silent but frowning during the ordeal.</Content><Content>"We cannot let it rest here."</Content><Content>"Certainly not!" snapped Miss Teddington firmly. "The matter must be</Content><Content>sifted to the bottom."</Content><Content>The two Principals conferred for a moment in whispers, then Miss Bowes</Content><Content>announced:</Content><Content>"Girls, this affair must be very carefully inquired into. I hoped it was</Content><Content>only a practical joke, but a circumstance came to my knowledge last</Content><Content>night which, I fear, may lend a more sinister aspect to it than either</Content><Content>Miss Teddington or I had imagined. I am most deeply disappointed that</Content><Content>the code of honour which we have always upheld at The Woodlands seems</Content><Content>by some of you to have been broken. I shall have more to say to you</Content><Content>later on. In the meantime you may go to your classrooms."</Content><Content>Very solemnly the girls turned to march in their separate forms from the</Content><Content>hall; but as IV B filed through the door there was a sudden outcry, a</Content><Content>hustling, a rush of other girls, and an excited, aghast crowd.</Content><Content>"It's here! It's here, Miss Bowes!" shouted Doris Deane. "Rona Mitchell</Content><Content>had it! It fell from her blouse pocket when she pulled out her</Content><Content>handkerchief."</Content><Content>"It's Rona!"</Content><Content>"We saw it fall!"</Content><Content>"She had it all the time!"</Content><Content>"Oh, the sneak!"</Content><Content>"Silence!" thundered Miss Bowes, ringing her bell.</Content><Content>In the midst of the sudden hush the Principal walked down the hall and</Content><Content>took the pendant from Doris's hand.</Content><Content>"What have you to say for yourself, Rona Mitchell?"</Content><Content>Rona was standing staring as if a ghost had suddenly risen up and</Content><Content>confronted her. Her vermilion colour had faded, and left her face deadly</Content><Content>white.</Content><Content>"Rona, do you hear me?"</Content><Content>Rona shivered slightly, glanced desperately at Miss Bowes, then cast her</Content><Content>eyes on the floor. She did not attempt to reply.</Content><Content>"I give you one more chance, Rona."</Content><Content>"Oh, Rona," interrupted Ulyth, who was weeping hot tears of dismay,</Content><Content>"remember the Camp-fire! For the sake of the school, Rona!"</Content><Content>She drew back, choking with emotion, as Miss Bowes waved her aside.</Content><Content>Rona gazed for a moment full at Ulyth--a long, long, searching gaze, as</Content><Content>if she would read Ulyth's very soul in her eyes. Then the colour flooded</Content><Content>back, a full tide of crimson, over brow and neck.</Content><Content>"Yes--for the sake of the school!" she repeated unsteadily, and,</Content><Content>bursting into tears, hid her burning face in her hands.</Content><Content>Miss Teddington hastily dismissed the other girls, and, coming to the</Content><Content>assistance of her partner, asked many questions. It was absolutely</Content><Content>useless, for Rona would not answer a single word.</Content><Content>"Go to your bedroom," said the irate Principal at last. "This matter</Content><Content>cannot be allowed to pass. If you had owned up at once nothing would</Content><Content>have been said, but such duplicity and obstinacy are unpardonable. Until</Content><Content>you make a full confession you must not mix with the rest of the school.</Content><Content>We should be sorry to have to send you back to New Zealand, but girls</Content><Content>with no sense of honour cannot remain at The Woodlands."</Content><Content>Still sobbing hysterically, Rona was policed upstairs by Miss Teddington</Content><Content>and locked into her bedroom. An hour or two of solitude might bring her</Content><Content>to her senses, thought the mistress, and break the stubborn spirit which</Content><Content>seemed at present to possess her. A wide experience of girls had proved</Content><Content>that solitary confinement soon quelled insubordination, and by</Content><Content>dinner-time the culprit would probably volunteer some explanation.</Content><Content>Both Principals were greatly upset by the occurrence. Hitherto the</Content><Content>little world at The Woodlands had jogged on without any more desperate</Content><Content>happenings than the breaking of silence rules or the omission of</Content><Content>practising. Never in all its annals had they been obliged to deal with a</Content><Content>case of such serious import.</Content><Content>Ulyth, with the rest of V B, was obliged to march off to her form-room.</Content><Content>The inquiry had delayed the morning's work, and Miss Harding began to</Content><Content>give out books without a moment's further waste of time. Ulyth sat</Content><Content>staring at the problem set her, without in the least taking in its</Content><Content>details. She could not apply her mind to the calculation of cubic</Content><Content>contents while Rona was crying her heart out upstairs. What did it, what</Content><Content>could it, all mean? Had her room-mate only been intending to play a</Content><Content>practical joke on Stephanie? If so, why had she not at once admitted the</Content><Content>fact? Nobody would have thought much the worse of her for it, as such</Content><Content>jokes had been rather the rage of late among the juniors. It seemed so</Content><Content>unlike Rona to conceal it; lack of candour had not been her fault</Content><Content>hitherto. She was generally proud of the silly tricks she was fond of</Content><Content>playing, and anxious to boast about them. She could not have been</Content><Content>deterred by dread of the Principals' displeasure. Only yesterday she had</Content><Content>marched into the study, to report herself for talking, with a sangfroid</Content><Content>that was the admiration of her form; and had come out again smiling,</Content><Content>with the comment that both the Rainbow and Teddie were "as decent as</Content><Content>anything if one owned up straight". No, there must be another and a much</Content><Content>graver explanation.</Content><Content>A chain of circumstances flashed through Ulyth's mind, each unfortunate</Content><Content>link fitting only too well. The evidence seemed almost overwhelming.</Content><Content>Rona had been present at the meeting by the stream when Tootie incited</Content><Content>the juniors to some secret act of rebellion against the school rules.</Content><Content>What this act was the occurrence in the garden had plainly shown. That</Content><Content>Rona had been implicated seemed a matter of certainty. Her brooch had</Content><Content>been in the possession of the cake-vendor, and she had chocolates in her</Content><Content>bedroom, the acquisition of which she had refused to explain. Did she</Content><Content>intend to keep the pendant and exchange it for confectionery? Her</Content><Content>pocket-money, as Ulyth knew, was exhausted, and she had hardly any of</Content><Content>the trinkets that most girls wear.</Content><Content>"Ulyth Stanton, you are not attending to your work. Give me your answer</Content><Content>to Problem 46."</Content><Content>Ulyth started guiltily. Her page was still a blank, and she had no</Content><Content>answer to produce. She murmured a lame excuse, and Miss Harding glared</Content><Content>at her witheringly. Thrusting her preoccupation resolutely aside, she</Content><Content>made an effort to concentrate her thoughts upon the subject in hand.</Content><Content>The morning passed slowly on. To Ulyth each successive class seemed</Content><Content>interminable. At recreation, the girls, in small clumps, discussed the</Content><Content>one topic of the hour.</Content><Content>"I'm not surprised. I'd think anything of Rona Mitchell," said</Content><Content>Stephanie. "What else could you expect of a girl from the backwoods?"</Content><Content>"But she was so much improved," urged Addie, who had rather a weakness</Content><Content>for the Cuckoo.</Content><Content>"Only a veneer. She relapsed directly she got the chance, you see."</Content><Content>"But why should she take your pendant?"</Content><Content>"I can't pretend to explain her motive, but take it she did--stealing, I</Content><Content>should call it. But we're too polite at The Woodlands to use such a</Content><Content>strong word."</Content><Content>"What'll be done to her?"</Content><Content>"Pack her back to New Zealand, I hope--and a good riddance. I always</Content><Content>said she wasn't a suitable girl to come to this school. She hasn't the</Content><Content>traditions of a lady. You might as well try to make a silk purse out of</Content><Content>a sow's ear as to get such a girl to realize the meaning of _noblesse</Content><Content>oblige_. It's birth that counts, after all, when it comes to the test."</Content><Content>"There I think you're wrong, Stephie," put in Lizzie quietly. "Gentle</Content><Content>birth is all very well if it involves preserving a code of honour, but</Content><Content>in itself it's no hall-mark of character. Some of the humblest and</Content><Content>poorest people have been the stanchest on a question of right, when</Content><Content>those above them in station have failed utterly. A charwoman can have</Content><Content>quite as high standards as a duchess, and often lives up to them much</Content><Content>better."</Content><Content>"Oh, you're a Radical!"</Content><Content>"I want fair play all round, and I must say that Rona has been very</Content><Content>straight and square so far. Nobody has ever accused her of sneaking."</Content><Content>"No; the bear cub was unpolished, but not a vicious little beastie,"</Content><Content>agreed Addie.</Content><Content>"And it had grown wonderfully tame of late," added Christine.</Content><Content>Rona did not appear at the dinner-table; she had been removed from her</Content><Content>own bedroom to a small spare room on another landing. She still refused</Content><Content>to answer any question put to her. Her silence seemed unaccountable, and</Content><Content>the Principals could only consider it as a display of temper.</Content><Content>"She was annoyed at being caught red-handed with the pendant in her</Content><Content>possession, and she won't give in and acknowledge her wrongdoing," said</Content><Content>Miss Teddington to Miss Bowes.</Content><Content>"From a strong hint Cook gave me last night I fear there is something</Content><Content>more behind it all," returned her partner. "I shall question every girl</Content><Content>in the school separately until I get at the truth."</Content><Content>Beginning with the monitresses, Miss Bowes summoned each pupil in turn</Content><Content>to her study and subjected her to a very strict catechism. From the</Content><Content>Sixth she gained no information. They formed a clique amongst</Content><Content>themselves, and knew little of the doings of the younger girls. V A were</Content><Content>likewise absorbed in their own interests, and only classed Rona as one</Content><Content>among many juniors. It was now the turn of V B, and Miss Bowes sent for</Content><Content>Ulyth a trifle more hopefully. She, at least, would have an intimate</Content><Content>knowledge of her room-mate.</Content><Content>"Have you ever known Rona mixed up in any deceit before? What is her</Content><Content>general report among her form-mates?" asked the Principal.</Content><Content>"Very square. She used to annoy me dreadfully when first she came by</Content><Content>turning over all my things, but she soon stopped when I told her how</Content><Content>horrid it was. She never dreamt of taking anything. It was the merest</Content><Content>curiosity; she hadn't been taught differently at home."</Content><Content>"Have you found her eating sweets or cakes in her bedroom lately?"</Content><Content>Ulyth hesitated and blushed.</Content><Content>"Ah! I see you have! You must tell me, Ulyth. Keep nothing back."</Content><Content>Very unwilling to betray her friend, Ulyth admitted the fact that</Content><Content>chocolate had been pressed upon her one evening.</Content><Content>"Did Rona explain where she got it?"</Content><Content>"No, she wouldn't tell me anything."</Content><Content>Miss Bowes looked thoughtful.</Content><Content>"I put you upon your honour, Ulyth, to answer this question perfectly</Content><Content>frankly. Have you any reason to suspect that some of the juniors have</Content><Content>surreptitiously been buying cakes and sweets?"</Content><Content>Thus asked point-blank, Ulyth was obliged to relate what she had</Content><Content>overheard; and Miss Bowes, determined to get at the root of the</Content><Content>business, cross-questioned her closely, until she had dragged from her</Content><Content>reluctant pupil the account of the occurrence in the garden and the</Content><Content>conversation with the travelling hawker-woman.</Content><Content>"This is more serious even than I had feared," groaned Miss Bowes. "I</Content><Content>thought I could have trusted my girls."</Content><Content>"I think most of them were ashamed of it," ventured Ulyth.</Content><Content>"It is just possible that Rona refuses to speak because she will not</Content><Content>involve her schoolfellows."</Content><Content>"Oh yes, yes!" cried Ulyth, clutching at any straw to excuse her</Content><Content>room-mate's conduct. "That's quite likely. Or, Miss Bowes, I've been</Content><Content>thinking that perhaps it was a queer kind of loyalty to me. You know</Content><Content>Rona's very fond of me, and she was quite absurdly angry because</Content><Content>Stephanie's pendant was to go to the exhibition and not mine. She may</Content><Content>have changed them, hoping it wouldn't be noticed and that mine would be</Content><Content>packed up, and perhaps she intended to put Stephanie's back in the</Content><Content>studio when the parcel had safely gone. Rona does such impulsive</Content><Content>things."</Content><Content>Miss Bowes shook her head sadly.</Content><Content>"I wish I could think so. Unfortunately the other circumstances lend</Content><Content>suspicion to a graver motive."</Content><Content>CHAPTER XVIII</Content><Content>Light</Content><Content>Ulyth walked from the study feeling that she had told far more than she</Content><Content>wished.</Content><Content>"I've given Rona away," she said to herself. "Miss Bowes is thinking the</Content><Content>very worst of her, I know. Oh dear! I wish she'd explain, and not keep</Content><Content>up this dreadful silence. It's so unlike her. She's generally almost too</Content><Content>ready to talk. If I could see her even for a few minutes I believe she</Content><Content>would tell me. Perhaps Miss Teddington frightened her. Poor Rona! She</Content><Content>must be so utterly miserable. Could I possibly get a word with her, I</Content><Content>wonder?"</Content><Content>She talked the matter over with Lizzie.</Content><Content>"If I ask Miss Bowes, she'll probably say no," lamented Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Then I shouldn't ask," returned Lizzie. "We've not been definitely</Content><Content>forbidden to see Rona."</Content><Content>"The door's locked."</Content><Content>"You've only to climb out of the linen-room window on to the roof of the</Content><Content>veranda."</Content><Content>"Why, so I could. Oh, I must speak to her!"</Content><Content>"I think you are justified, if you can get anything out of her. She'd</Content><Content>tell you better than anybody else in the whole school."</Content><Content>"I'll try my luck then."</Content><Content>"I'll stand in the garden below and shout 'Cave!' if I hear anyone</Content><Content>coming."</Content><Content>To help her unfortunate room-mate seemed the first consideration to</Content><Content>Ulyth, and she thought the end certainly justified the means. She waited</Content><Content>until after the tea interval, when most of the girls would be playing</Content><Content>tennis or walking in the glade; then, making sure that Lizzie was</Content><Content>watching in the garden below, she stole upstairs to the linen-room. It</Content><Content>was quite easy to drop from the window on to the top of the veranda, and</Content><Content>not very difficult, in spite of the slope, to walk along to the end of</Content><Content>the roof. Here an angle of the old part of the house jutted out, and the</Content><Content>open window of Rona's prison faced her only a couple of yards away. She</Content><Content>could not reach across the gap, but conversation would be perfectly</Content><Content>possible.</Content><Content>"Rona!" she called cautiously. "Rona!"</Content><Content>There was a movement inside the room, and a face appeared at the window.</Content><Content>Rona's eyes were red and swollen with crying, and her hair hung in wild</Content><Content>disorder. At the sight of Ulyth she started, and stared rather</Content><Content>defiantly.</Content><Content>"Rona! Rona, dear! I've been longing to see you. I felt I must speak to</Content><Content>you."</Content><Content>No reply. Rona, in fact, turned her back.</Content><Content>"I'm so dreadfully sorry," continued Ulyth. "I've been thinking about</Content><Content>you all day. It's no use keeping this up. Do confess and have done with</Content><Content>it."</Content><Content>Rona twisted round suddenly and faced Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Rona! You'd be so much happier if you'd own up you'd taken it. Surely</Content><Content>you only meant it as a joke on Stephie? Miss Bowes will forgive you. For</Content><Content>the sake of the school, do!"</Content><Content>Then Rona spoke.</Content><Content>"You ask me to confess--you, of all people!" she exclaimed with</Content><Content>unconcealed bitterness.</Content><Content>"Yes, dear. I can't urge it too strongly."</Content><Content>"You want me to tell Miss Bowes that I took that pendant?"</Content><Content>"There's no sense in concealing it, Rona."</Content><Content>The Cuckoo's eyes blazed. Her hands gripped the window-sill.</Content><Content>"Oh, this is too much! It's the limit! I couldn't have believed it</Content><Content>possible! You, Ulyth! you to ask me this! How can you? How dare you?"</Content><Content>Ulyth gazed at her in perplexity. She could not understand such an</Content><Content>outburst.</Content><Content>"Surely I, your own chum, have the best right to speak to you for your</Content><Content>own good?"</Content><Content>"My own good!" repeated Rona witheringly. "Yours, you mean. Oh yes, it's</Content><Content>all very fine for you, no doubt! You're to get off scot free."</Content><Content>"I? What are you talking about?"</Content><Content>"Don't pretend you don't understand. You atrocious sneak and</Content><Content>hypocrite--you took the pendant yourself!"</Content><Content>If she had been accused of purloining the Crown jewels from the Tower of</Content><Content>London, Ulyth could not have been more astonished.</Content><Content>"I----!" she stammered. "I----!"</Content><Content>"Yes, you, and you know it. I saw you."</Content><Content>"You couldn't!"</Content><Content>"But I did, or as good as saw you. Who came into our room last night, I</Content><Content>should like to know, when Miss Lodge had sent me to bed, and slipped</Content><Content>something into one of the blouses hanging behind the door? I'd forgotten</Content><Content>by the morning, but I remembered when the pendant came jerking out of my</Content><Content>pocket."</Content><Content>"Certainly I didn't put it there!"</Content><Content>"But you did. You came into the room, took off your outdoor coat, and</Content><Content>threw it on your bed. I got up, afterwards, and hung it up in your</Content><Content>wardrobe for you. Irene told me how you'd joined the cake club. She said</Content><Content>you had the password quite pat."</Content><Content>Ulyth was too aghast to answer. Rona, once she had broken silence,</Content><Content>continued in a torrent of indignation.</Content><Content>"You a Torch-bearer! You might well ask me not to expose you! 'Remember</Content><Content>the Camp-fire,' you said. Yes, it's because of the Camp-fire, and for</Content><Content>the sake of the school, that I've kept your secret. Don't be afraid. I'm</Content><Content>not going to tell. It wouldn't be good for the League if a Torch-bearer</Content><Content>toppled down so low! It doesn't matter so much for only a Wood-gatherer.</Content><Content>I won't betray a chum--I've brought that much honour from the Bush; but</Content><Content>I'll let you know what I think about you, at any rate."</Content><Content>Then, her blaze of passion suddenly fading, she burst into tears.</Content><Content>"Ulyth, Ulyth, how could you?" she sobbed. "You who taught me everything</Content><Content>that was good. I believed in you so utterly, I'd never have thought it</Content><Content>of you. Oh, why----"</Content><Content>"Cave! cave!" shouted Lizzie excitedly below. "Cave! Teddie herself!"</Content><Content>Ulyth turned and fled with more regard for speed than safety along the</Content><Content>veranda roof, and scrambled through the window into the linen-room</Content><Content>again. She was trembling with agitation. Such an extraordinary</Content><Content>development of the situation was as appalling as it was unexpected. She</Content><Content>must have time to think it over. She could not bear to speak to anybody</Content><Content>about it at present, not even to Lizzie. No, she must be alone. She ran</Content><Content>quickly downstairs, and, before Lizzie had time to find her, dived under</Content><Content>the laurels of the shrubbery and made her way first down the garden and</Content><Content>then to the very bottom of the paddock that adjoined the high road.</Content><Content>There was a little copse here, of trees and low bushes, which sheltered</Content><Content>her from all observation. Nobody was likely to come and disturb her, for</Content><Content>the girls preferred the glade, and seldom troubled to enter the paddock.</Content><Content>She flung herself down on the grass and tried to face the matter calmly.</Content><Content>She had begged Rona to confess, and Rona in return had accused her of</Content><Content>taking the pendant. This was turning the tables with a vengeance. How</Content><Content>could her room-mate have become possessed of such a preposterous idea?</Content><Content>And in what a web of mystery the affair seemed involved! One certainty</Content><Content>came as an immense relief. Rona was not guilty. More than this, she was</Content><Content>behaving with an extraordinary amount of courage and loyalty.</Content><Content>"She believes I took it, and yet she is bearing all the blame, and</Content><Content>shielding me for the sake of the school," groaned Ulyth. "Oh, what must</Content><Content>she be thinking of me! We're all at cross-purposes. Did she really fancy</Content><Content>that when I said: 'Remember the Camp-fire', I was begging her to screen</Content><Content>me? Somebody took the pendant and put it in her pocket; that's the ugly</Content><Content>part of the business. It's throwing the blame from one to another. What</Content><Content>we've got to do is to find out the real guilty person, and that's not</Content><Content>going to be easy, I'm afraid."</Content><Content>Ulyth sighed and wiped her eyes. She had been deeply hurt at Rona's</Content><Content>sudden attack. It is humiliating to find that where you occupied a</Content><Content>pedestal you are now, even temporarily, a broken idol.</Content><Content>"She's right to scorn me if she imagines I'm such a sneak, but how could</Content><Content>she suppose I would? And yet I thought her guilty. Oh dear, it's a</Content><Content>horrible muddle! How shall we ever get it straight?"</Content><Content>Ulyth sat thinking, thinking, and was no nearer to a solution of her</Content><Content>problem when she suddenly heard the brisk ringing of a bicycle-bell on</Content><Content>the road below. Springing up eagerly, she rushed to the wall, and</Content><Content>shouted just in time to stop Mrs. Arnold, whose machine was whisking</Content><Content>past.</Content><Content>"Hallo, Ulyth! What are you doing there?"</Content><Content>"I'm coming over. Do please wait for me!"</Content><Content>And Ulyth, scrambling somehow across the wall, slid down a gravelly bank</Content><Content>on to the road.</Content><Content>"You're the one person in the world I want to see," she added, hugging</Content><Content>her friend impetuously. "Oh, Mrs. Arnold, the most dreadful things have</Content><Content>been happening at school! Somebody took Stephie's pendant, and it fell</Content><Content>out of Rona's pocket, and everybody thinks Rona took it, and Rona thinks</Content><Content>it's me. What are we to do?"</Content><Content>"Sit down here and tell me all about it. Yes, please, begin at the very</Content><Content>beginning, and don't leave anything out, however trivial. Sometimes the</Content><Content>little things are the most important. Cheer up, child! We'll get to the</Content><Content>bottom of it, never fear."</Content><Content>Sitting on the bank, with Mrs. Arnold's arm round her, Ulyth related the</Content><Content>whole of her story, mentioning every detail she could remember. It was</Content><Content>such a comfort to pour it out into sympathetic ears, and to one whose</Content><Content>judgment was more likely to be unbiased than that of anyone connected</Content><Content>with the school.</Content><Content>"You always understand," she said, with a sigh of relief, as she kissed</Content><Content>the hand that was holding hers.</Content><Content>"It certainly is a tangled skein to unravel; but, as it happens, I</Content><Content>really believe I can throw a little light upon the matter. You say Rona</Content><Content>told you that somebody came into her bedroom last night, and presumably</Content><Content>hid the pendant in her blouse pocket?"</Content><Content>"Yes; and she was sure that somebody was myself."</Content><Content>"Then what we have to do is to produce the real culprit."</Content><Content>"If we can find her."</Content><Content>"Just now I was wheeling my bicycle up Tyn y Bryn Hill, and I met one</Content><Content>of the boys from Jones's farm. He stopped me and handed me a letter. 'A</Content><Content>girl gave it to me five minutes ago,' he said. 'She asked me if I was</Content><Content>going to the village, and if I'd post it for her; so I promised I would.</Content><Content>But it's addressed to you, so I may as well give it to you as post it,</Content><Content>and save the stamp.' I read the letter, and it puzzled me extremely. I</Content><Content>hardly knew what to make of it; but since you've told me about the</Content><Content>pendant I think I begin to understand its meaning. You shall see it for</Content><Content>yourself."</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold spread out the letter on her knee, so that Ulyth might read</Content><Content>it. It was written on village note-paper, in a childish hand, with no</Content><Content>stops.</Content><Content>    "DEAR MRS ARNOLD</Content><Content>    "this comes hoping to find you as well as it leves me at present i</Content><Content>    am in dredful trubble and i cannot stay here eny longer dear Mrs</Content><Content>    Arnold after what cook said this afternoon i am sure she knows all</Content><Content>    and i daresunt tell miss Bowes but you are the camp fire lady and i</Content><Content>    feel i must say goodbye to ease your mind dear Mrs Arnold wen you</Content><Content>    get this letter I shall be Far Away as it says in the song you tort</Content><Content>    us by the stream and you will never see me agen but i shall think of</Content><Content>    you alwus and the camp fire and i wish i hadn't dun it only I was</Content><Content>    skared to deth for she said she wuld half kill me and she alwus</Content><Content>    keeps her wurd your obedient servant Susannah Maude Hawley."</Content><Content>"Susannah Maude!" exclaimed Ulyth. "I never even thought of her. Is it</Content><Content>possible that she could have taken the pendant?"</Content><Content>"From the letter it looks rather like it. It is very mysterious, and I</Content><Content>cannot understand it all; but the girl appears to have done something</Content><Content>she shouldn't, and to have run away."</Content><Content>"Where has she run to?"</Content><Content>"She can't have gone very far. She evidently did not mean me to receive</Content><Content>this letter until to-morrow morning, as she asked Idwal Jones to post</Content><Content>it. He forestalled her intention by giving it to me now. It's a most</Content><Content>fortunate thing, as we may be able to overtake her. She is probably</Content><Content>walking to Llangarmon, and cannot have gone more than a few miles by</Content><Content>this time. I shall follow her at once on my machine, and shall most</Content><Content>likely come up with her before she even reaches Coed Glas."</Content><Content>"Oh, let me go with you!" pleaded Ulyth, starting to her feet and</Content><Content>seizing the bicycle. "I could ride on the carrier. I've often done it</Content><Content>before. Oh, please, please!"</Content><Content>"What about school rules?"</Content><Content>"Miss Bowes wouldn't mind if you took me. Just this once!"</Content><Content>"Well, I suppose my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame if we</Content><Content>get into trouble about it."</Content><Content>"Oh, we shan't! We must find Susannah Maude. Miss Bowes would want us to</Content><Content>stop her running away."</Content><Content>"Come along then, and mind you balance yourself, so that you don't upset</Content><Content>us."</Content><Content>"Trust me!" chuckled Ulyth delightedly.</Content><Content>Back along the road by which she had come sped Mrs. Arnold, past the</Content><Content>lane that led to her own house, and away in the direction of Llangarmon.</Content><Content>Ulyth managed to stick on without impeding her progress, and felt a</Content><Content>delirious joy in the stolen expedition. To be out with her dear Mrs.</Content><Content>Arnold on such an exciting adventure was an hour worth remembering. She</Content><Content>could not often get the Guardian of the Fire all to herself in this</Content><Content>glorious fashion. She would be the envy of the school when she returned.</Content><Content>Susannah Maude was apparently a quick walker. They passed through the</Content><Content>hamlet of Coed Glas, and were half a mile beyond before they caught</Content><Content>sight of the odd little figure trudging on ahead. They overtook her</Content><Content>exactly on the bridge that crossed the Llyn Mawr stream.</Content><Content>As Mrs. Arnold dismounted and called her by name, Susannah Maude</Content><Content>started, uttered a shriek, and apparently for a moment contemplated</Content><Content>casting herself into the stream below. The Guardian of the Fire,</Content><Content>however, seized her firmly by the arm, and, drawing her to the low</Content><Content>parapet, made her sit down.</Content><Content>"Now tell me all about it," said Mrs. Arnold encouragingly, seating</Content><Content>herself by her side. For answer Susannah Maude wept unrestrainedly, the</Content><Content>hot tears dripping down her hard little cheeks into her rough little</Content><Content>hands.</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold waited with patience till the storm had subsided, then she</Content><Content>began to put questions.</Content><Content>"Did you take the young lady's locket, Susan?"</Content><Content>"Yes, I did; but I didn't want to. I wouldn't if I hadn't been so</Content><Content>scared. I'm scared to death now as she'll find me."</Content><Content>"You needn't be afraid of Miss Bowes."</Content><Content>"I ain't. Leastways not so bad. It's her I'm feared of."</Content><Content>"Whom do you mean, child?"</Content><Content>"Her--my mother."</Content><Content>"I didn't know you had a mother. I thought you were an orphan," burst</Content><Content>out Ulyth.</Content><Content>"I wish I was. No, my father and mother wasn't dead--they was both</Content><Content>serving time when I was sent to the Home. When Mother come out she got</Content><Content>to know where I was, and she kept an eye on me; then when I comes here</Content><Content>to a situation she turns up one day at the back door and says she wants</Content><Content>my wages. I give her all I got; but that didn't satisfy her--not much!</Content><Content>She was always hanging about the place. She used to come and sell sweets</Content><Content>and cakes, unbeknown-like, to the young ladies."</Content><Content>"Was that your mother? The gipsy woman with the basket?" exclaimed</Content><Content>Ulyth.</Content><Content>"That was her, sure enough. She pestered me all the time for money, and</Content><Content>then when she found I'd got none left she said I must bring her</Content><Content>something instead. 'The young ladies must have heaps of brooches and</Content><Content>lockets, and things they don't want, so just you fetch me one,' sez she;</Content><Content>'and if you don't I'll catch you and half kill you.' Oh, I can tell you</Content><Content>I was scared to death! I don't want not to be honest; but she'd half</Content><Content>killed me once or twice before, when I was a kid, and I know what her</Content><Content>hand's like when she uses it."</Content><Content>"So you took something?"</Content><Content>"Yes. I waited till the young ladies was all at supper; then I got down</Content><Content>one of their coats from the pegs in the corridor and slipped it over my</Content><Content>black dress and apron, and I put on one of their hats. I thought if I</Content><Content>was seen upstairs they'd take me for one of themselves. I went into the</Content><Content>studio, and there, right opposite on a little table, was that kind of</Content><Content>locket thing. I slipped it in my pocket, and looked round the room. If</Content><Content>there wasn't another just like it on the bench! I took that, and put it</Content><Content>on the table. It wasn't likely, perhaps, it would be missed as quick as</Content><Content>the other. Then I thought I'd better be going. I was just walking down</Content><Content>the landing when I hears a step, and darts into one of the bedrooms.</Content><Content>'Suppose they catches me,' thinks I, 'with one of the young ladies'</Content><Content>coats and hats on and the locket in my hand!' There was a blouse hanging</Content><Content>behind the door, with a little pocket just handy, so I stuffed the</Content><Content>locket down into that; then I pulled off the coat and threw it on the</Content><Content>bed, and flung the hat out of the window. I thought if anyone came in</Content><Content>and found me I'd say I'd been sent to refill the water-jug. But the</Content><Content>steps went on, and I rushed out and downstairs, and left the locket</Content><Content>where it was. I was so scared I didn't know what I was doing."</Content><Content>"Gracie found her hat in the garden this morning," gasped Ulyth. "She</Content><Content>wondered how it got there."</Content><Content>"But what made you run away?" asked Mrs. Arnold, returning to the main</Content><Content>question. "Did you think you were suspected?"</Content><Content>"Not till this afternoon. Then the servants were all talking in the</Content><Content>kitchen about how one of the young ladies was supposed to have taken</Content><Content>what they called a 'pendon' or something, and Cook looked straight at me</Content><Content>and says: 'If anything's missing, it's not one of the young ladies</Content><Content>that's got it, I'll be bound.' And I turned red and run out of the</Content><Content>kitchen. My mother'd said she'd be coming round this evening, and how</Content><Content>was I going to meet her with no locket? So I says, there's nothing else</Content><Content>for it, I'd best go back to the Home. Miss Bankes, she was good to me,</Content><Content>and Mother daresn't show her face there. So I wrote a letter, and asked</Content><Content>Jones's boy to post it. I didn't think you'd get it till to-morrow."</Content><Content>"Very fortunately I received it at once. You must come back with us now</Content><Content>to The Woodlands, Susan. We shall all have to walk, for the bicycle</Content><Content>won't take three."</Content><Content>"I'll wheel it," cried Ulyth joyfully.</Content><Content>"She'll half kill me to-night," quavered poor Susannah Maude. "Do let me</Content><Content>go to the Home!"</Content><Content>"Your mother shall not have a chance of coming near you. You must tell</Content><Content>all this to Miss Bowes; then to-morrow, if you wish, you may be sent</Content><Content>back to the Orphanage."</Content><Content>No successful scouts could have returned to camp with more triumph than</Content><Content>Mrs. Arnold and Ulyth, as, very late and decidedly tired, they arrived</Content><Content>at The Woodlands to relate their surprising story. Miss Bowes sent at</Content><Content>once for Rona, and in the presence of the Principals the whole matter</Content><Content>was carefully explained to the satisfaction of all parties, even poor</Content><Content>weeping Susannah Maude.</Content><Content>"I am very glad to find the motive for which Rona kept silence was so</Content><Content>good a one," commented Miss Teddington. "She has shown her loyalty both</Content><Content>to her friend and to the school."</Content><Content>Dismissed with honour from the study, Ulyth and Rona were hugging each</Content><Content>other in the privacy of the boot cupboard.</Content><Content>"Can you ever forgive all the horrible things I said?" implored Rona. "I</Content><Content>think I was off my head. I might have known it wasn't--couldn't be</Content><Content>possible; you are you--the one girl I've been trying to copy ever since</Content><Content>I came here."</Content><Content>"You've quite as much to forgive me, dear, and I beg your pardon. I'm so</Content><Content>glad it's all straight and square now."</Content><Content>"You darling! I don't mind telling you it was Tootie who gave me those</Content><Content>chocolates."</Content><Content>"Didn't you buy them from the cake-woman?"</Content><Content>"I never bought anything from her. I didn't join the cake club."</Content><Content>"Then how did she get hold of your New Zealand brooch? She showed it to</Content><Content>me."</Content><Content>"Why, I'd swopped that brooch with Tootie for a penknife ages ago. We're</Content><Content>always swopping our things in IV B."</Content><Content>"The whole business seems to have been a comedy of errors," said Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Some mischievous Puck threw dust in our eyes and blinded us to the</Content><Content>truth."</Content><Content>After all, it was the juniors that suffered most, for Miss Teddington,</Content><Content>who had been very angry at the whole affair, turned the vials of her</Content><Content>wrath upon them, and took them to task for their illicit traffic in</Content><Content>cakes. This, at any rate, she was determined to punish, and not a</Content><Content>solitary sinner was allowed to escape. Tootie, the original leader in</Content><Content>rebellion, issued from her interview in the study such a crushed worm as</Content><Content>to stifle any lingering seeds of mutiny among her crestfallen followers.</Content><Content>"What's to become of Susannah Maude?" asked everybody; and Miss Bowes</Content><Content>answered the question.</Content><Content>"I am taking the poor child back to the Orphanage. I have told the</Content><Content>police to warn her disreputable mother from this neighbourhood; but, as</Content><Content>one can never be certain when she might turn up again, we must remove</Content><Content>Susan altogether out of reach of her evil influence. A party of girls</Content><Content>will be sent from the Home very soon to Canada, and we shall arrange for</Content><Content>her to join them and emigrate to a new country, where she will be placed</Content><Content>in a good situation on a farm and well looked after. She is not really a</Content><Content>dishonest girl, and has a very grateful and affectionate disposition. I</Content><Content>am confident that she will do us credit in the New World, and turn out a</Content><Content>useful and happy citizen. Why yes, girls, if you like to make her a</Content><Content>little good-bye present before she sails, you may do so. It is a kind</Content><Content>thought, and I am sure she will appreciate it greatly."</Content><Content>"There's only one item not yet wiped out on the slate," said Ulyth to</Content><Content>Lizzie. "Perhaps I ought to report myself for walking along the veranda</Content><Content>roof. I'd feel more comfortable!"</Content><Content>"Go ahead, then! Teddie's at the confessional now."</Content><Content>"It's never been exactly forbidden," said Ulyth, with a twinkle in her</Content><Content>eye, after she had stated the extent of her enormity to Miss Teddington.</Content><Content>"I would as soon have thought of forbidding you to climb the chimneys!</Content><Content>It was a dangerous experiment, and certainly must not be repeated. I'm</Content><Content>surprised at a senior! No, as you have told me yourself, I will not</Content><Content>enter it in your conduct-book. Please don't parade the roofs in future.</Content><Content>Now you may go."</Content><Content>"Got off even easier than I expected," rejoiced Ulyth to the waiting</Content><Content>Lizzie. "Teddie's bark's always worse than her bite."</Content><Content>"We've found that out long ago," agreed Lizzie.</Content><Content>CHAPTER XIX</Content><Content>A Surprise</Content><Content>The storm-clouds that had gathered round the mystery of the lost pendant</Content><Content>seemed to clear the air, and sunshine once more reigned at The</Content><Content>Woodlands. The juniors were on their very best behaviour; they indulged</Content><Content>in no more surreptitious expeditions and abandoned their truculent</Content><Content>attitude towards the elder girls, who, while careful to preserve their</Content><Content>dignity as seniors, were ready to wipe off old scores and start afresh.</Content><Content>Some manoeuvres in connection with the Camp-fire League proved a bond</Content><Content>of union, for here there was no distinction between Upper and Lower</Content><Content>School, since all were novices to the new work and had to learn alike.</Content><Content>None, indeed, had any time at present to get into mischief. As the end</Content><Content>of the term, with its prospects of examinations, drew near, even the</Content><Content>most hardened shirkers were obliged to put their shoulders to the wheel,</Content><Content>and show a certain amount of intimacy with their textbooks. A nodding</Content><Content>acquaintance with French verbs or the rules of Latin Grammar might</Content><Content>suffice to shuffle through the ordinary lessons in form, but would be a</Content><Content>poor crutch when confronted with a pile of foolscap paper and a set of</Content><Content>questions, and likely to lead to disparaging items in their reports.</Content><Content>In every department, therefore, there was a flood-tide of effort.</Content><Content>Nature-study diaries, roughly kept, were neatly copied; lists of birds</Content><Content>and flowers were revised; the geological specimens in the museum were</Content><Content>rearranged and labelled, the art treasures in the studio touched up,</Content><Content>while pianos seemed sounding from morning to night. The school was on</Content><Content>its mettle to appear at high-water mark. Miss Bowes had lately</Content><Content>instituted an Old Girls' Union for The Woodlands, the first gathering of</Content><Content>which was to be held in conjunction with the breaking-up festivity.</Content><Content>Quite a number of past pupils had accepted the invitation, and people of</Content><Content>influence in the neighbourhood were also expected to be present.</Content><Content>"You must show the 'old girls' what you can do," said Miss Bowes, who</Content><Content>was naturally anxious to make a good impression on the visitors. "I want</Content><Content>them to think the standard raised, not lowered. Some of our ways will be</Content><Content>new to them, and we must prove that the changes have been for the</Content><Content>better."</Content><Content>It certainly seemed a goal to work for. Even the most irresponsible</Content><Content>junior would feel humiliated if the "old girls" were to consider that</Content><Content>the school had gone down, and all took a just pride in keeping up its</Content><Content>reputation.</Content><Content>"Noëlle Derrington and Phyllis Courtenay have accepted"--it was</Content><Content>Stephanie who volunteered the information. "They have both been</Content><Content>presented. And Irene Vernon has promised to come. She's been out two</Content><Content>years now. I do hope those wretched kids in IV B will behave themselves.</Content><Content>Manners have gone off at The Woodlands in my opinion, even if the</Content><Content>work's better. When my sister was a junior, she says, they would as soon</Content><Content>have thought of ragging the mistresses as of cheeking the seniors."</Content><Content>"O tempora! O mores!" laughed Addie. "When you're an old lady, Stephie,</Content><Content>you'll spend all your time lamenting the good old days of your youth,</Content><Content>and telling the children just how much better-behaved girls used to be</Content><Content>when you were at school."</Content><Content>"I shan't say so of our juniors, at any rate," snorted Stephanie.</Content><Content>"Have you heard yet who's coming from the neighbourhood?" Beth enquired.</Content><Content>"Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, of course, and Colonel and Mrs. Hepworth, and the</Content><Content>Mowbrays, and the Langtons."</Content><Content>"Lord and Lady Glyncraig have accepted; Miss Harding told me so just</Content><Content>now," remarked Christine.</Content><Content>"Oh, what luck!" Stephanie's eyes sparkled. "It will just give the</Content><Content>finishing touch to the affair."</Content><Content>"Did you say that Lord and Lady Glyncraig are coming to our breaking-up</Content><Content>party?" asked Rona quickly. She had joined the group in company with</Content><Content>Winnie and Hattie.</Content><Content>"So I understand; but you needn't excite yourself. It isn't likely</Content><Content>they'll notice juniors, though they'll probably speak to a few seniors</Content><Content>whom they already know."</Content><Content>"Including Miss Stephanie Radford, of course," scoffed Winnie. "We</Content><Content>shall expect to see you walking arm in arm with them round the grounds."</Content><Content>"And hear them giving you a most pressing invitation to Plas Cafn,"</Content><Content>Hattie added. "You don't get asked there as often as one would suppose,</Content><Content>considering you're so intimate with them."</Content><Content>"The cheek of juniors grows beyond all bounds!" declared Stephanie,</Content><Content>stalking away. "I'm afraid I know what Irene Vernon will think of the</Content><Content>school."</Content><Content>It was of course impossible for all the parents of the girls to come to</Content><Content>the "At Home", but a certain proportion had promised to be present.</Content><Content>There was a good hotel at Llangarmon, and they could put up there, and</Content><Content>drive over for the occasion. The neighbourhood was so beautiful that</Content><Content>several would take the opportunity of spending a few days in</Content><Content>sightseeing.</Content><Content>"I've news to tell you," said Ulyth to Rona one morning, her face</Content><Content>radiant as she showed a letter. "Who do you think are coming to the</Content><Content>party? Motherkins and Oswald! Ossie'll just be home in time, so they're</Content><Content>jaunting off to Elwyn Bay like a pair of honeymooners. Motherkins hasn't</Content><Content>been very well, and Dad says the sea air will do her good--he can't</Content><Content>leave business himself, more's the pity! Won't it be glorious to see</Content><Content>them here! I could stand on my head, I'm so glad."</Content><Content>The prospect of meeting any members of the Stanton family again was a</Content><Content>great pleasure to Rona, who treasured the memory of the Christmas</Content><Content>holidays as her happiest experience in England. Mrs. Fowler was also to</Content><Content>be present, so she would see the friend who had been kind to her at</Content><Content>Eastertide as well.</Content><Content>"I'm glad my mother's coming," said Winnie. "When most of the other</Content><Content>girls have somebody, its so horrid to be left out. Poor old Rona! I wish</Content><Content>you'd got some relations of your own who could be here. It's hard luck!"</Content><Content>A shade crossed Rona's face. She hesitated, as if about to speak, then,</Content><Content>apparently changing her mind, kept silence.</Content><Content>"What an idiotic duffer you are!" whispered Hattie to Winnie. "You</Content><Content>needn't be always reminding her what a cuckoo she is."</Content><Content>"The Cuckoo's got its feathers now, and has grown a very handsome bird,"</Content><Content>said Winnie, watching Rona as the latter walked away.</Content><Content>The At Home was to be chiefly a gathering for the Old Girls' Union, but</Content><Content>the present pupils were to provide a short programme, consisting of</Content><Content>music and recitations, to occupy a portion of the afternoon. Only the</Content><Content>brightest stars were selected to perform.</Content><Content>"The school's got to show off!" laughed Gertie. "It's to try and take</Content><Content>the shine out of the old girls. Miss Bowes doesn't exactly like to say</Content><Content>so, but that's what she means."</Content><Content>"No inferior talent permitted," agreed Addie. "Only freshwater oysters</Content><Content>may wag their tails."</Content><Content>"Metaphor's a little mixed, my hearty. Perhaps you'll show us an</Content><Content>oyster's tail?"</Content><Content>"Well, they've got beards, at any rate."</Content><Content>"To beard the lion with?"</Content><Content>"If you like. I suppose Lord Glyncraig will be the lion of the</Content><Content>afternoon. We shall have to perform before him."</Content><Content>"Oh, I'm so thankful I'm not clever enough to be on the programme!"</Content><Content>After careful consideration of her pupils' best points, Miss Ledbury,</Content><Content>the music-mistress, had at last compiled her list. She put Rona down for</Content><Content>a song. Rona's voice had developed immensely since she came to school.</Content><Content>For a girl of her age it had a wonderfully rich tone and wide compass.</Content><Content>Miss Ledbury thought it showed promise of great things later on, and,</Content><Content>while avoiding overstraining it, she had made Rona practise most</Content><Content>assiduously. There was rather a dearth of good solo voices in the school</Content><Content>at present, most of the seniors having more talent for the piano than</Content><Content>for singing, otherwise a junior might not have obtained a place on the</Content><Content>coveted programme.</Content><Content>"But of course Rona's not exactly a junior," urged Ulyth in reply to</Content><Content>several jealous comments. "She's fifteen now, although she's only in IV</Content><Content>B, and she's old for her age. She's miles above the kids in her form. I</Content><Content>think Teddie realizes that. I shouldn't be at all surprised if Rona</Content><Content>skips a form and is put into the Upper School next term. She'd manage</Content><Content>the work, I believe. It's been rather rough on her to stay among those</Content><Content>babes."</Content><Content>"Well, I say Miss Ledbury might have chosen a soloist from V B,"</Content><Content>returned Beth icily. She was not a Rona enthusiast.</Content><Content>"Who? Stephie's playing the piano and Gertie's reciting, Merle croaks</Content><Content>like a raven, you and Chris don't learn singing, Addie's no ear for</Content><Content>tune, and the rest of us, as Leddie says, 'have no puff'. I'm glad Rona</Content><Content>can do something well for the school. She's been here three terms, and</Content><Content>she's as much a Woodlander now as anyone else."</Content><Content>Rona herself seemed to regard her honour with dismay. The easy</Content><Content>confidence which she had brought from New Zealand had quite disappeared,</Content><Content>thanks to incessant snubbing; she was apt now to veer to the side of</Content><Content>diffidence.</Content><Content>"Do you think I'll break down?" she asked Ulyth nervously.</Content><Content>"Not a bit of it. Why should you? You know the song and you know you can</Content><Content>sing it. Just let yourself go, and don't think of the audience."</Content><Content>"Very good advice, no doubt, but a trifle difficult to follow," pouted</Content><Content>Rona. "Don't think of the audience, indeed, when they'll all be sitting</Content><Content>staring at me. Am I to shut my eyes?"</Content><Content>"You can look at your song, at any rate, and fancy you're alone with</Content><Content>Miss Ledbury."</Content><Content>"Imagination's not my strong point. I wish the wretched performance was</Content><Content>over and done with."</Content><Content>There were great preparations on the morning of 29th July. Outside, the</Content><Content>gardeners were giving a last roll to the lawns, and a last sweep to the</Content><Content>paths. In the kitchen the cook was setting out rows of small cakes, and</Content><Content>the parlour-maid in the pantry was counting cups and spoons, and</Content><Content>polishing the best silver urn. In the school department finishing</Content><Content>touches were put everywhere. Great bowls of roses were placed in the</Content><Content>drawing-room, and jars of tall lilies in the hall. The studio, arranged</Content><Content>yesterday with its exhibits of arts and handicrafts, was further</Content><Content>decorated with picturesque boughs of larch and spikes of foxgloves. Two</Content><Content>curators were told off to explain the museum to visitors, and</Content><Content>tea-stewards selected to help to hand round cups and cakes. A band of</Content><Content>special scouts picked raspberries and arranged them on little green</Content><Content>plates. Chairs were placed in the summer-house and under the trees in</Content><Content>view of the lawn. The rustic seats were carefully dusted in the glade by</Content><Content>the stream.</Content><Content>By three o'clock the school was in a flutter of expectation.</Content><Content>"Do I look--decent?" asked Rona anxiously, taking a last nervous peep at</Content><Content>her toilet in the wardrobe mirror.</Content><Content>"Decent!" exclaimed Ulyth. "You're for all the world like a Sir Joshua</Content><Content>Reynolds portrait. I'd like to frame you, just as you are, and hang you</Content><Content>on the wall."</Content><Content>"You wouldn't feel ashamed of me if--if you happened to be my relation?</Content><Content>I've improved a little since I came here, haven't I? I was a wild sort</Content><Content>of goose-girl when I arrived, I know."</Content><Content>"The goose-girl is a Princess to-day," said her room-mate exultantly.</Content><Content>Ulyth thought Rona had never looked so sweet. The pretty white dress</Content><Content>trimmed with pale blue edgings suited her exactly, and set off her</Content><Content>lovely colouring and rich ruddy-brown hair. Her eyes shone like</Content><Content>diamonds, and the mingled excitement and shyness in her face gave a</Content><Content>peculiar charm to her expression.</Content><Content>"She's far and away the prettiest girl in the school," reflected Ulyth.</Content><Content>"If there were a beauty prize, she'd win it."</Content><Content>Everybody was waiting in the garden when the guests arrived. The scene</Content><Content>soon became gay and animated. There were delighted welcomings of</Content><Content>parents, enthusiastic meetings between old school chums, and a hearty</Content><Content>greeting to all visitors. Mrs. Stanton and Oswald had driven in a taxi</Content><Content>from Elwyn Bay, and were received with rapture by Ulyth.</Content><Content>"Motherkins! Oh, how lovely to see you again! I must have you all to</Content><Content>myself for just a minute or two before I share you with anybody--even</Content><Content>Rona!"</Content><Content>"Is that Rona over there?" asked Oswald, gazing half amazed at the</Content><Content>friend who seemed to have added a new dignity to her manner as well as</Content><Content>inches to her stature since Christmas-tide.</Content><Content>"Yes, go and fetch her to speak to Motherkins."</Content><Content>"I hardly like to. She looks so stately and grown-up now."</Content><Content>"What nonsense! Ossie, you can't be shy all of a sudden. What's come</Content><Content>over you, you silly boy? There, I'll beckon to Rona. Ah, she sees us,</Content><Content>and she's coming! No, I'm afraid she can't sit next to us at the</Content><Content>concert, because she's one of the performers, and will have to be in the</Content><Content>front row."</Content><Content>The ceremonies were to take place in the hall, after which tea would be</Content><Content>served to the company out-of-doors.</Content><Content>"Lord Glyncraig is to act as chairman," whispered Addie. "Stephie is so</Content><Content>fearfully excited. She means to go and speak to him and Lady Glyncraig</Content><Content>afterwards. I hope to goodness they won't have forgotten her. She'd be</Content><Content>so woefully humiliated. She wants us all to see that she knows them.</Content><Content>She's been just living for this afternoon, I believe."</Content><Content>Rona, her hands tightly clasped, watched the tall figure mount the</Content><Content>platform. Lord Glyncraig, with his clear-cut features, iron-grey hair,</Content><Content>and commanding air, looked a born leader of men, and well fitted to take</Content><Content>his share in swaying a nation's destiny. She could picture him a power</Content><Content>in Parliament. It was good of him to come this afternoon to speak at a</Content><Content>girls' school. Lady Glyncraig, handsome, well-dressed, and aristocratic,</Content><Content>sat in the post of honour next to Miss Bowes. Rona noticed her gracious</Content><Content>reception of the beautiful bouquet handed to her by Catherine, and</Content><Content>sighed as she looked.</Content><Content>There were no prizes at The Woodlands this year, for the girls had asked</Content><Content>to devote the money to the Orphanage; but the examination lists and the</Content><Content>annual report were read, and some pleasant comments made upon the scope</Content><Content>of the Old Girls' Union. Lord Glyncraig had a happy gift of speech, and</Content><Content>could adapt his remarks to the occasion. Everybody felt that he had said</Content><Content>exactly the right things, and Principals, mistresses, parents, and</Content><Content>pupils past or present were wreathed in smiles. These opening ceremonies</Content><Content>did not take very long, and the concert followed immediately.</Content><Content>Marjorie's Prelude, Evie's Nocturne, Stephanie's Mazurka, and Gertie's</Content><Content>recitation all went off without a hitch, and received their due reward</Content><Content>of appreciation. It was now Rona's turn. For a moment she grew pale as</Content><Content>she mounted the platform, then the coral flushed back into her cheeks.</Content><Content>She had no time to think of the audience. Miss Ledbury was already</Content><Content>playing the opening bars:</Content><Content>    "Come out, come out, my dearest dear!</Content><Content>      Come out and greet the sun!"</Content><Content>Mellow and tuneful as a blackbird's, Rona's clear rich young voice rang</Content><Content>out, so fresh, so joyous, so natural, so full of the very spirit of</Content><Content>maying and the glory of summer's return, that the visitors listened as</Content><Content>one hearkens to the notes of a bird that is pouring forth its heart from</Content><Content>a tree-top in the orchard. There was no mistake about the applause.</Content><Content>Guests and girls clapped their hardest. Rona, all unwilling, was</Content><Content>recalled, and made to sing an encore, and as she left the platform</Content><Content>everybody felt that she had scored the triumph of the occasion.</Content><Content>"Glad the juniors weren't excluded. It's a knock-down for Steph,"</Content><Content>whispered Addie.</Content><Content>"Trust Miss Ledbury not to leave out Rona. She'll be our champion</Content><Content>soloist now," returned Christine.</Content><Content>The rest of the little programme was soon finished, and the audience</Content><Content>adjourned to the garden for tea. Stephanie, with a tray of raspberries</Content><Content>and cream, came smilingly up to Lord and Lady Glyncraig, and,</Content><Content>introducing herself, reminded them of the delightful visit she had paid</Content><Content>to Plas Cafn. If they had really forgotten her, they had the good</Content><Content>manners not to reveal the fact, and spoke to her kindly and pleasantly.</Content><Content>"By the by," said Lord Glyncraig, "where is your schoolfellow who sang</Content><Content>so well just now? I don't see her on the lawn."</Content><Content>"Rona Mitchell? I suppose she is somewhere about," replied Stephanie</Content><Content>casually.</Content><Content>"Do you happen to know if she comes from New Zealand?"</Content><Content>"Yes, she does."</Content><Content>"I wonder if you could find her and bring her here? I should like very</Content><Content>much to speak to her."</Content><Content>Stephanie could not refuse, though her errand was uncongenial. She could</Content><Content>not imagine why an ex-Cabinet Minister should concern himself with a</Content><Content>girl from the backwoods.</Content><Content>"Lord Glyncraig wants you; so hurry up, and don't keep him waiting," was</Content><Content>the message she delivered, not too politely.</Content><Content>Rona blushed furiously. She appeared on the very point of declining to</Content><Content>obey the summons.</Content><Content>"Go, dear," said Mrs. Stanton quietly. "Perhaps he wishes to</Content><Content>congratulate you on the success of your song. Yes, Rona, go. It would be</Content><Content>most ungracious to refuse."</Content><Content>With a face in which shyness, nervousness, pride, and defiance strove</Content><Content>for the mastery, Rona approached Lord Glyncraig. He held out his hand to</Content><Content>her.</Content><Content>"Won't you bury the hatchet, and let us be friends at last, Rona?" he</Content><Content>said. "I'm proud of my granddaughter to-day. You're a true chip of the</Content><Content>old block, a Mitchell to your finger-tips--and" (in a lower tone) "with</Content><Content>your mother's voice thrown into the bargain. Blood is thicker than</Content><Content>water, child, and it's time now for bygones to become bygones. I shall</Content><Content>write to your father to-night, and set things straight."</Content><Content>       *       *       *       *       *</Content><Content>"How is it that you've actually been a whole year at The Woodlands and</Content><Content>never let anybody have the least hint that Lord Glyncraig is your</Content><Content>grandfather? Don't you know what an enormous difference it would have</Content><Content>made to your position in the school? Stephie is quite hysterical about</Content><Content>it. Why was it such a dead secret?" asked Ulyth of her room-mate, as</Content><Content>they took off their party dresses, when the guests had gone.</Content><Content>"It's rather a long story," replied Rona, sitting down on her bed. "In</Content><Content>the first place, I dare say you've guessed that Dad was the prodigal of</Content><Content>the family. He never did anything very bad, poor dear, but he was packed</Content><Content>off to the colonies in disgrace, and told that he might stay there. At</Content><Content>Melbourne he met a lovely opera singer, who was on tour in Australia,</Content><Content>and married her. That made my grandfather more angry than anything else</Content><Content>he had done. I'm not ashamed of my mother. She was very clever, and sang</Content><Content>like an angel, I'm told, though I can't remember her. When she died, Dad</Content><Content>went to New Zealand and started farming. Mrs. Barker was hardly an ideal</Content><Content>person to bring me up, but she was the only woman we could get to stop</Content><Content>in such an out-of-the-way place. I must have been an awful specimen of a</Content><Content>child; I don't like to remember what things I did then. When I was about</Content><Content>ten, Father went away for a few weeks to the North Island, and while he</Content><Content>was gone, Mrs. Barker went off in the gig to have a day's shopping at</Content><Content>the nearest store. She left me alone in the house. I wasn't frightened,</Content><Content>for I was quite accustomed to it. No one but a chance neighbour ever</Content><Content>came near. Yet that day was just the exception that proves the rule.</Content><Content>Early in the afternoon a grand travelling motor drove up, and a lady and</Content><Content>gentleman knocked at the door, and enquired for Dad. I was a little wild</Content><Content>rough thing then, and I was simply scared to death at the sight of</Content><Content>strangers. I told them Dad was away. Then they asked if they might come</Content><Content>in, and the gentleman said he was my grandfather, and the lady was his</Content><Content>new wife, so that she was my step-grandmother. Now Mrs. Barker had</Content><Content>always rubbed it in to me that if I was left alone I must on no account</Content><Content>admit strangers. That was the only thing I could think of. I was in a</Content><Content>panic, and I slammed the door on them and bolted it, and then ran to the</Content><Content>window and pulled faces, hoping to make them go away. They stood for a</Content><Content>minute or two quite aghast, trying to get me to listen to reason through</Content><Content>the window, but I only grew more and more frightened, and called them</Content><Content>all the ugly names I could.</Content><Content>"'It's no use attempting to tame such a young savage,' said the lady at</Content><Content>last. Then they got into their car again and drove away.</Content><Content>"By the time Mrs. Barker arrived I was ashamed of myself, so I said</Content><Content>nothing about my adventure, and I never dared to tell Dad a word of it.</Content><Content>I suppose his father had come to hunt him up; but he was evidently</Content><Content>discouraged at the reception he had received at the farm, and went back</Content><Content>to England without making another attempt at a meeting. I don't believe</Content><Content>he and Dad ever wrote to each other from year's end to year's end. I</Content><Content>tried to forget this, but it stuck in my memory all the same. Time went</Content><Content>by, my friendship with you began, and it was decided that I should be</Content><Content>sent to The Woodlands. I knew my grandfather lived at Plas Cafn, for Dad</Content><Content>had told me about his old home, but I did not know it was so near to the</Content><Content>school. You ask why I did not tell the girls that I was related to Lord</Content><Content>Glyncraig? There were several reasons. In the first place, I was really</Content><Content>very much ashamed of my behaviour the day he had come to our farm. I</Content><Content>thought he had cast us off completely, and would not be at all pleased</Content><Content>to own me as granddaughter. I would not confess it to any of you, but I</Content><Content>felt so rough and uncouth when I compared myself with other girls that I</Content><Content>did not want Lord Glyncraig to see me, or to know that I was in the</Content><Content>neighbourhood. Perhaps some day, so I thought, I might grow more like</Content><Content>you, if I tried hard, and then it would be time enough to tell him of my</Content><Content>whereabouts. Then, because he had disowned us, I felt much too proud to</Content><Content>boast about the relationship at school. If you could not like me for</Content><Content>myself, I wouldn't make a bid for popularity on the cheap basis of</Content><Content>being his granddaughter. I'm a democrat at heart, and I think people</Content><Content>ought to be valued on their own merits entirely. I'd rather be an</Content><Content>outsider than shine with a reflected glory."</Content><Content>"You'll be popular now," said Ulyth. "Are you to spend the holidays at</Content><Content>Plas Cafn?"</Content><Content>"Yes. Miss Bowes says I must, though I'd far rather have accepted your</Content><Content>invitation. Lady Glyncraig was very kind and sweet; she kissed me and</Content><Content>said she hoped so much that we should be friends. They have promised to</Content><Content>ask Dad to come over for next Christmas and have a big family reunion."</Content><Content>"You won't let them take you away from The Woodlands? We don't want to</Content><Content>lose you, dear. You must stay here now--for the sake of the school."</Content><Content>"For my own sake!" cried Rona, flinging her arms round her friend.</Content><Content>"Ulyth, I owe everything in the world to you. I understand now how good</Content><Content>it was of you to take me into your room and teach me. I was a veritable</Content><Content>cuckoo in your nest then, a horrid, tiresome, trespassing bird, a</Content><Content>savage, a bear cub, a 'backwoods gawk' as the girls called me. It's</Content><Content>entirely thanks to you if at last I'm----"</Content><Content>"The sweetest Prairie Rose that ever came out of the wilderness!"</Content><Content>finished Ulyth warmly.</Content></document>
