## Project 1

In this project, you're given a text file with chess tournament results where the information has some structure. Your job is to create an R Markdown file that generates a .CSV file (that could for example be imported into a SQL database) with the following information for all of the players: Player's Name, Player's State, Total Number of Points, Player's Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents For the first player, the information would be:

Gary Hua, ON, 6.0, 1794, 1605

1605 was calculated by using the pre-tournament opponents' ratings of 1436, 1563, 1600, 1610, 1649, 1663, 1716, and dividing by the total number of games played.

TEXTFILE <- "tournamentinfo.txt"
chessResults = readLines(TEXTFILE)
