## Project 2

Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information included in the dataset. You're encouraged to use a "wide" structure similar to how the information appears in the discussion item, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.

Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data. [Most of your grade will be based on this step!]

Perform the analysis requested in the discussion item.

Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. 
```{r echo = TRUE}

```
